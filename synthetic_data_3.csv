My name is Harryram Almousily, and I am a proud 52-year-old white female glazier based in the beautiful state of Washington, USA. With a journey that started right here on American soil, I’ve grown both personally and professionally, culminating in the completion of my Doctorate degree. Despite the often challenging path I’ve walked, my role as a glazier, a profession I cherish deeply, allows me to create and work with glass artfully in various settings.

While juggling personal and professional responsibilities, I’ve learned the importance of continuous learning and resilience. Whether overseeing a project downtown or working on residential assignments, I immerse myself completely in my craft, blending technical skills with an artistic vision.

I’m always keen on connecting with like-minded professionals and exchanging insights on the nuances of our trade.

I work as a glazier, and I've been in the industry for over 25 years now. It's a unique profession, but I absolutely love working with glass and seeing the transformational impact it has on various structures. 

I was born and raised in the United States and have made a point to stay close to my roots. I pursued my education with vigor and pride myself on having earned a doctorate degree, which might seem unusual for someone in my line of work. I believe that knowledge and skill can go hand-in-hand no matter your field!

Currently, I'm divorced and navigating the single life once again. It's been a journey, and like many others who have gone through this, I've had my share of ups and downs. I find solace in my work and hobbies, especially hiking through the beautiful parks of Washington and working on intricate glass art projects.

My annual income is about $55,160, which keeps me comfortable enough to enjoy activities that I love, such as visiting local eateries and traveling occasionally. I don't have kids, so I channel much of my energy into my career and personal growth.

If anyone has questions about being a glazier or balancing a demanding job with personal life, feel free to ask. I’d also love to connect with fellow Washingtonians or anyone going through similar life experiences.

Recently, I’ve been reflecting on my journey, especially after completing my Doctorate degree — yes, you read that right! Balancing my career and diving deep into academic waters was no easy feat, but it’s something I’m incredibly proud of. 

For those curious, yes, I’m currently divorced, but I believe that chapter of my life has made me stronger and more resilient. I find joy in my work and cherish the tranquility of my life in Washington. My annual earnings of $55,160 allow me to live comfortably and pursue my passions without too much worry.

I’m planning on celebrating my recent accomplishments by taking a bit of time off to visit some of my favorite local spots. Maybe a hike around Mount Rainier or a peaceful afternoon at Lake Chelan.

Thanks for all the support over the years, especially to my close friends and family who have been there for me through thick and thin. Here’s to more adventures ahead!

My name is Rajdei Danun, and I’m a 65-year-old Black woman residing in the heart of Alabama, USA. I've been navigating the intricate world of numbers and human interactions for decades. Currently, I serve as a Gambling Cage Worker and take pride in my role. It’s a fascinating job where accuracy and people skills are paramount. 

I earned my professional degree several years ago from Tuskegee University, which laid the foundation for my career. Over the years, I have experienced the highs and lows of life, including the painful loss of my beloved spouse. Navigating widowhood has shaped me into a resilient and compassionate individual, always striving to help others find joy in their lives, even in the bustling environment of a casino.

On top of my professional commitments, I am deeply embedded in my local community in Montgomery, where I volunteer with local senior centers, sharing stories and wisdom with the younger generation. My journey has taught me the importance of perseverance, and I always encourage others to follow their ambitions, regardless of the obstacles they face.

My name is Rajdei Danun, and I'm a 65-year-old Black female living and working in Alabama, USA. I'm a Gambling Cage Worker, where I handle all sorts of transactions in the casino. It's a lively environment that keeps me on my toes—certainly not what you'd expect from a typical job for someone my age, right? I earn $33,370 a year, and honestly, it's just enough to keep me comfortable.

I was born and raised here in the United States and have a professional degree that I worked hard to earn, even while juggling my job and family obligations. It's not something everyone in my generation from my community got to do, so I hold it close to my heart. I’m currently widowed, which has been tough. My husband passed away a few years back, and life hasn't been the same since. We had a strong bond, and honestly, he was my rock.

Life here in Alabama has its ups and downs. The summers can be unbearably hot, but there's something about the Southern hospitality that warms my heart even more. I'm an active member of my church, which gives me a strong sense of community and belonging. I find solace and strength in my faith, especially after my loss. 

During my free time, I love gardening and have a little vegetable patch in my backyard. Watching those tiny seeds grow into something beautiful and useful is kind of like therapy for me. My tomatoes and okra plants are my pride and joy!

So, that's a snapshot of my life. If anyone has any questions about the casino life, gardening, or just wants to chat, feel free to reach out. Life is too short not to connect with people, so here I am.

Though he’s no longer physically with me, the memories of our beloved trips bring warmth to my heart.

On a lighter note, I’m planning a little gathering this Sunday at my place. We’ll have some good Southern cooking – fried chicken, collard greens, and sweet potato pie.

My name is Sursattie Gopee, and I am a 59-year-old Construction Equipment Operator based in Oklahoma, USA. Born and raised in the United States, I hold a professional degree in my field. It’s my life's work, and I’m proud to have built a solid career over the years, currently earning $58,910 annually.

Recently, I found myself reflecting on my journey, especially since I’ve been widowed. My late wife, Karen, was my rock, and now it’s just me and my memories. Despite the hardships, I’ve persisted in my profession, ensuring that every project I work on stands as a testament to my dedication and her lasting influence on my life.

Currently, I’m working on a major infrastructure project here in Oklahoma, which has been both challenging and rewarding. Operating heavy machinery and contributing to the structures that people use every day is incredibly fulfilling. I’ve always believed in the importance of building not just structures, but also a legacy of quality and integrity.

When I’m not on the job, I enjoy visiting local places like the Oklahoma City National Memorial. It’s a spot that reminds me of the resilience of our community, something I strive to embody both in my personal life and at work.

To younger professionals in the construction industry – your dedication and hard work will pay off. Keep pushing through the challenges. Every operator, every builder, has a story, and we all contribute to the fabric of our society in meaningful ways.

Thank you for reading, and let’s keep building a better tomorrow, one project at a time.

My name is Sursattie Gopee, and I am a 59-year-old Black male living in Oklahoma. I've been working as a Construction Equipment Operator for over 30 years now. I was born right here in the United States, and I’m proud to have completed my professional degree in my early years. My annual income sits at $58,910, which has helped me enjoy a comfortable life despite the ups and downs.

I’ve been widowed for the past 8 years. Losing my wife was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to endure. We met during my final year of college and were married for almost 28 years before she passed away. She was my rock, my partner, and my everything.

Living in Oklahoma has its perks; the wide-open spaces and close-knit community have always been a source of comfort for me. I have three amazing children, all grown up and thriving in their own paths. My eldest, John, is 35 and works as a software engineer in Texas. My middle child, Rochel, 32, is a nurse here in Oklahoma, and my youngest, Mark, 28, is currently finishing up his MBA in New York.

My line of work is physically demanding, but I’ve always found satisfaction in operating heavy machinery, from cranes to bulldozers. The feeling of seeing a project come to life from the ground up—there’s nothing quite like it.

In my free time, I enjoy fishing at Lake Eufaula and playing chess at the local community center. My late wife and I used to spend weekends exploring nature trails in the Ouachita National Forest; those are cherished memories I hold close.

I look forward to hearing from others who might share similar experiences or those who work in the same industry. Life's too short not to connect with others and share our stories.

Best regards,
Sursattie Gopee

I hope you're all doing well. My name is Sursattie Gopee, and I'm a proud 59-year-old man living here in Oklahoma. Just wanted to share a bit about my life lately. As some of you know, I work as a Construction Equipment Operator—a job I've been doing for years now. It's demanding, but I love it. There's something about seeing a project come together from the ground up that's incredibly satisfying. 

With my professional degree in hand, I’ve managed to secure a good job that pays $58,910 annually. It's not just about the money though; it's about doing something I truly care about. 

Being widowed has been tough, and I miss my late wife every day. But I hold on to the beautiful memories we created together. She was my rock, and even though she's no longer with me, I know she's watching over. 

Also, I’ve picked up gardening recently to keep myself busy, and it’s been a wonderful therapeutic outlet. You should see the tomatoes and peppers I’ve grown! 

Thank you for listening to my story and for being a part of my journey. Here's to cherishing every moment and making the most out of life.

Take care,

My name is Altamash Muljibhai, and I am a 59-year-old American Indian female residing in the beautiful state of Michigan, USA. My journey in the professional world has been a unique and rewarding one, leading me to a fulfilling career as a woodworker. With a professional degree backing my knowledge and skills, I’ve been able to carve out a niche for myself in the intricate and creative realm of woodworking.

I'm proud to share that I have been working as a woodworker for many years, specifically in the ""All Other"" category, which encompasses a wide variety of custom woodworking projects. From bespoke furniture to intricate wooden art pieces, each project allows me to infuse my creativity and expertise into something truly special. Despite the challenges, the joy of transforming raw wood into items of beauty and function is what keeps me motivated every day.

Living in Michigan, a state known for its rich forests and vibrant artisan communities, has been incredibly inspiring. The local scenery often serves as a muse for my work, and I feel deeply connected to the natural materials I use. My yearly salary is $36,870, which, while modest, is supplemented by the immense satisfaction I get from my craft.

On a more personal note, I am currently divorced. While life's twists and turns have led me down this path, they have also taught me resilience and strength. This personal journey has only enriched my work, allowing me to approach each project with a depth of experience and emotional awareness.

As I continue to grow and evolve in my craft, I look forward to connecting with fellow professionals, art enthusiasts, and potential collaborators here on LinkedIn. Let’s share our passion for creating beautiful and meaningful work, and perhaps find opportunities to learn from each other.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Here's to a future filled with creativity and collaboration!

I live alone now, but my little workshop is my sanctuary. It's filled with the sweet, earthy scent of lumber and the hum of tools. I spend hours there channeling my creativity into each piece I create. 

In my free time, I love exploring the serene nature Michigan offers. It’s a great way to find inspiration for my work. And I must admit, being divorced and having all this time for myself has its own perks.

I’d love to connect with other woodworking enthusiasts or anyone who has a passion for crafting. Also, any tips on how to better market my creations would be greatly appreciated!

Looking forward to hearing from you all!

My name is Khaleda Massri, a 40-year-old Biological Technician currently living in picturesque Nebraska, USA. Originally born in the United States, I hold a Bachelor's degree, allowing me the fascinating career where I dive into the world of living organisms every day. 

Today, I wanted to share an update about a project I'm particularly proud of, one that underscores the passion and commitment I bring to my work. Recently, I’ve been deeply involved in a research initiative focusing on sustainable agricultural practices. In our bustling lab at Natural Resources District (NRD), we've been analyzing soil samples to develop more effective, eco-friendly farming techniques. This project is close to my heart, as Nebraska's agricultural heritage is something I have always cherished.

Navigating professional life with a yearly income of $53,560 has had its challenges, especially since my separation. Balancing financial responsibilities and maintaining a fulfilling career can sometimes be a juggling act, but it’s one I undertake with persistent dedication. 

I’m always open to connecting with fellow scientists, researchers, and like-minded professionals who share a passion for biological sciences and sustainable practices. Let’s collaborate, share knowledge, and drive forward impactful change in our industry.

My name is Khaleda Massri. I'm a 40-year-old white male, living and working in Nebraska. I work as a Biological Technician, and I absolutely love my job even though it can be challenging at times. My annual income is $53,560, so I manage to get by, but I'm always looking for ways to stretch a dollar further.

I was born and raised here in the U.S., and I completed my Bachelor's degree in Biology about 18 years ago. Currently, I'm separated from my partner, which has been quite a transition, but we're both navigating it as best as we can. Sometimes, it feels like a chapter of my life has closed, and I'm trying to figure out what's next.

My work mainly involves assisting in biological research, often in a lab setting. One of the more exciting projects I'm involved in at the moment includes studying the impact of agricultural practices on local ecosystems. Living in Nebraska, agriculture is a huge part of our landscape—both literally and figuratively—so it feels good to contribute to something that touches so many lives around me.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the beautiful natural spaces around us. On weekends, you might find me hiking through Indian Cave State Park or fishing at Lake McConaughy. Being outdoors really helps me clear my mind and reconnect with myself amidst all the hustle and bustle of daily responsibilities.

I also have a pet cat named Zeus, who has been my loyal companion through thick and thin. He's a bit of a troublemaker, always knocking things off the counter and demanding attention, but I wouldn't trade him for the world.

That's a bit about me! Looking forward to connecting with some of you and hearing about your own stories and experiences.

Hope you're all doing well. Just wanted to share a bit about my life recently. For those who don't know, I'm a 40-year-old biological technician based in Nebraska. I’ve been working in this field for quite a while now, and I’m passionate about what I do. Born and raised in the United States, I completed my Bachelor's degree in biology a few years back.

Life has been a bit of a rollercoaster lately, especially since my separation. Being single again after a long relationship is definitely a new experience, but I'm staying positive and taking things one step at a time. Adjusting to this new chapter in life has been challenging, but my work keeps me grounded.

On a lighter note, I recently received my salary statement, and this year, I’m pulling in $53,560. It may not make me rich, but it’s enough to support my needs and some indulgences like my weekend hikes around the beautiful trails of Nebraska. 

I have two kids who are my world. My daughter is 12 and loves science just like her dad. My son, on the other hand, is 10 and he is all about soccer. I'm doing my best to balance work and spending quality time with them.

Feel free to drop a message or give me a call – always happy to catch up. Life is too short to lose touch with the ones who matter. Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a fantastic day ahead!

Best,

My name is Rajwantie Assaidi, and I am a 57-year-old Native Hawaiian male. I currently work as a Food Preparation Worker in the windy plains of Wyoming, USA. Life here is quite different from my birthplace of Tonga, where I spent my early years before moving to the mainland. I'm widowed now, and it's been a tough journey after losing my wife, but I've found a sense of purpose in my work and in the small community here. 

I completed my Bachelor's degree years ago, which seems like a lifetime ago now. My job here earns me $30,720 a year, and while it may not seem like much to some, it helps keep me grounded. Sometimes, after a long day of prepping meals, I think back nostalgically to the beaches of Hawaii and the vibrant culture I grew up with. I'm a simple man, and these sandwiches I prepare daily remind me of the importance of nourishing others—something my late wife always emphasized.

I’m also a huge fan of gardening. I find peace in my small vegetable garden, and it reminds me of the lush greenery of my home in Tonga. My neighbors here often ask me about the ""exotic"" plants in my garden—little do they know it's just a piece of my past. 

Wyoming might not have the ocean views I'm accustomed to, but it has its own rugged beauty. I've learned to love the open spaces and the friendly people. So, if any of you folks out there are looking to know more about the unique path I've walked, or perhaps need some culinary tips from a guy who's lived in two distinctly different worlds, feel free to ask.

For those who don’t know much about me, I’m a 57-year-old Native Hawaiian living in the beautiful yet chilly state of Wyoming. I work hard every day as a food preparation worker and although it can be exhausting, it’s incredibly rewarding to see people enjoy the meals I help create.

I was born and raised in Tonga, which is a small island nation in the South Pacific, and I hold a Bachelor's degree that I earned before moving to the States. It’s been a journey making Wyoming my home, but I've embraced it with open arms, despite missing the ocean breeze back in Tonga.

Life has its ups and downs, especially since I lost my wife a few years ago. Being widowed has been tough, but I’m grateful for the memories we shared and our amazing journey together.

I earn $30,720 a year, which isn't much, but it's enough to get by and enjoy some simple pleasures. On my days off, I love hiking in the stunning Wyoming landscape, and I often find solace and peace in those quiet moments with nature.

Just the other day, I was thinking about how different life is here compared to Tonga. The change of scenery and lifestyle has been a big adjustment, but it's also been an adventure. I miss the warm beach days, but the mountains here have their own kind of magic.

Anyway, that’s a bit about me. I’m always happy to make new friends, so feel free to reach out and connect. Aloha and take care!

My name is Parbatie Benacia, and I'm a 68-year-old Black female currently residing in the scenic state of Vermont, USA. I work as an Engineering Technologist and Technician, not exactly drafting but close enough—it keeps me busy and engaged. Originally, I'm from Papua New Guinea, where I was born and spent the early years of my life before moving to the USA for further education and opportunities. Despite the chilly winters here in Vermont, I find the peace and serenity it offers quite soothing.

I’ve also completed my Doctorate degree, which was an enriching journey filled with both challenges and accomplishments. Science and technology have always been my passions, which is why I pursued this field. It’s definitely a fulfilling career, though it can be demanding at times. Reflecting on my 48 years of professional experience, I can say that becoming an engineer and reaching this level was worth every sleepless night.

In terms of personal life, I’m currently divorced. Relationship statuses change, but life goes on, and I have found solace and joy in my work and hobbies. One of my hobbies is gardening; Vermont's lush landscapes are ideal for my little herb and vegetable garden, which I tend to with great care. I also have a son, who is now in his late 30s and has a family of his own. We talk often, and he visits me with his children whenever they can manage a break from their bustling lives in Massachusetts.

Financially, I earn a steady $66,780, which, coupled with my meticulous budgeting skills, allows me to live comfortably and even save for occasional splurges. I am also an avid reader. Recently, I've been diving into books on the intersection of technology and ethics—a topic that both fascinates and concerns me as our world becomes increasingly digitized.

Thanks for taking the time to read a bit about me. I look forward to engaging in the riveting discussions here on Reddit and maybe even sharing some gardening tips or tech insights.

My name is Parbatie Benacia, and I just celebrated my 68th birthday last week. Reflecting on my journey, I feel so grateful for all the experiences that have shaped me. For those who don't know, I was born in the beautiful landscapes of Papua New Guinea, and I've come a long way to now call Vermont my home. 

Professionally, I work as an Engineering Technologist here in Vermont, and I absolutely love what I do. After I completed my Doctorate degree, which was no small feat, I've been diving deep into the technical aspects of engineering, and it's been a rewarding career. 😊 

Despite having been divorced, I've embraced this chapter of my life with open arms and have been enjoying the serenity of Vermont. My annual income is $66,780, which gives me the means to indulge in my hobbies and passions. One of my favorite pastimes is tending to my garden and attending pottery classes at the local community center. 

I just wanted to share a little update with all of you. Spring is in the air, and I'm looking forward to planting some new flowers. Anyone have suggestions for perennials that thrive in New England weather? 🌸

Hello Reddit community!

My name is Mahase Ajodha, and I’m a 73-year-old Native Hawaiian woman currently residing in the beautiful state of Idaho, USA. I wanted to share a little bit about my journey, both personally and professionally, and maybe connect with others who have walked somewhat in my shoes.

I’ve had the pleasure of working as an Electro-Mechanical and Mechatronics Technologist and Technician for many years now. With a Master’s degree under my belt, I’ve seen the landscape of technology evolve in ways I could never have imagined when I first started out. Who would have thought that a girl born in the United States in 1950 would grow up to work with such cutting-edge technology?

Living in Idaho gives me a sense of peace and tranquility, a far cry from the bustling Hawaiian islands of my youth. Though, I must say, I do miss the ocean breeze and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. Idaho has its charm, especially in its breathtaking nature and the friendly community. Plus, it’s been a great place for me to focus on my work without the distractions of a big city.

At the age of 73, I’m still very much involved in my field. Some might find it unusual, but I love what I do, and it keeps me young at heart. There’s a satisfaction that comes from solving complex problems and seeing the tangible results of my work. My annual earnings of $65,920, while not extraordinary, are quite sufficient for a single woman who has never married. Financial independence has always been important to me, and I have been fortunate enough to achieve it.

Being never married, I often receive curious inquiries about my decision. For me, it was always about the freedom to pursue my passions and interests. My work and my hobbies have filled my life with meaning. To all the younger women out there, I want to say it's perfectly okay to choose a different path that makes you happy.

In my downtime, I enjoy immersing myself in nature, going on hikes, and sometimes just sitting with a good book. Idaho has some stunning trails that have become my escape after long days working on tech projects. Keeping active is essential, especially as I grow older.

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s either in a similar field or maybe shares a bit of my background. How do you balance work and personal life, especially as you age? Any favorite hiking trails or nature spots you could recommend in Idaho or elsewhere? Let's share and learn from each other's experiences.

Thanks for reading!

In addition to our love for the outdoors, I have a passion for coding and data analysis, which reflects in my professional life too. I also enjoy cooking, especially experimenting with Asian cuisines, and Raj often jokes that our kitchen feels like a mini-restaurant with all the different flavors and aromas.

We don't have children, but we do have an adorable Labrador Retriever named Mochi. Mochi has been with us for six years and is an essential part of our family. Every evening, no matter how busy the day has been, we ensure we take Mochi for a walk around our neighborhood.

My name is Shazam Ramsuchit, and I’m a 42-year-old Native Hawaiian male living in sunny Florida. I work as a Stationary Engineer and Boiler Operator and earn about $72,570 a year. I was born and raised here in the United States and recently completed my Doctorate degree, which I’m incredibly proud of. 

Life has thrown a few curveballs my way, and one of the hardest was the loss of my wife. I’ve been widowed for the past three years, and while it’s been tough, I find solace in my work and my friends.

On weekends, I love to head out to the coast and indulge in some paddleboarding. There's something about the ocean that always brings me back to my Hawaiian roots. I am a huge fan of traditional Hawaiian music, and you’ll often find me playing the ukulele in my free time.

Anyone else here in Florida? Would love to connect with fellow stationary engineers or anyone with an interest in engineering and steam boilers. Let’s share stories and maybe even grab a cup of coffee sometime!

Greetings, LinkedIn Community!

For those who may not know, my name is Tuoc Zagala, and I am thrilled to share a bit of my professional journey with you all. As someone who has dedicated the past 15 years to working as an Elevator and Escalator Installer and Repairer, I can genuinely say that every day brings something new and challenging, which I absolutely love.

My career began here in Massachusetts shortly after I earned my Associate degree. With a passion for mechanical systems and a keen eye for detail, I knew this path was right for me. Over the years, I’ve had the pleasure of working on some of the most intricate and high-profile projects in the state, and it’s been nothing short of fulfilling.

What makes this journey even more special is the support I receive from my wonderful husband. We’ve been together through the thick and thin of it all, raising our two beautiful children while balancing our careers. His encouragement has been a pillar of strength as I navigated the often demanding but incredibly rewarding field of elevator and escalator maintenance.

This year, we celebrated a personal milestone—our new home in the heart of Massachusetts. It’s been a dream come true for us and has provided a great environment for our kids to grow and thrive. 

On a professional note, I am currently earning an annual salary of $93,960, and while it’s been a tremendous journey so far, I am eager to continue learning and growing. I am looking forward to connecting with more professionals in our industry and sharing insights and experiences that can help us all move upwards (pun intended) in our careers.

Here’s to many more years of elevating success, both personally and professionally!

Warm regards,
Tuoc Zagala

So, my husband and I are embarking on a pretty exciting journey. We've been living in Massachusetts for almost a decade now, and we've finally decided to take the plunge and buy our first home together. It's been a long time coming, but it feels like the right moment, especially with both of us being well-settled in our careers.

I work as an Elevator and Escalator Installer and Repairer, which, while it may seem a bit niche, has been incredibly rewarding. There's something satisfying about making sure people’s daily commutes go smoothly and safely. Plus, the pay isn't too shabby; I earn around $93,960 a year. It's physically demanding, but I love the challenge and the feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day. My husband jokes that I'm always ""leveling up"" in my own way.

We've shortlisted a few neighborhoods, and now it's just about finding that perfect place. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster trying to match our desire for a cozy, modern space with something affordable. Plus, a decent backyard is non-negotiable as we're planning to adopt a dog soon. It's been a little stressful, but we hope our patience pays off.

For anyone else here who's recently bought a home in Massachusetts, any tips or things to watch out for? Specifically in terms of property value trends or any hidden costs that might catch us by surprise? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

Hello, LinkedIn family!

Today, I’m over the moon as I reflect on my 50-year journey in the construction management field. My name is Saido Kishuni, and at 74 years old, I’m proud to see how our industry has evolved and how far we’ve come.

I began this journey right after completing my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering. Back then, there were very few women, especially American Indian women, in this line of work. Even fewer could make it to a managerial position. But as they say, determination knows no bounds. I dedicated myself to learning, building relationships, and overseeing projects that I believed would make a difference.

I’ve had the privilege of overseeing some major projects, including the expansion of our local hospital and several infrastructure developments here in Idaho. Each project has been a testament to the power of teamwork, persistence, and a vision for a better tomorrow.

As a widow, my work and the people I work with have been my second family. They’ve seen me through some of the most challenging and rewarding times of my life. It’s not often you meet people who share not just in your challenges, but in your triumphs as well.

On a personal note, my annual earnings of $112,790 have allowed me to contribute to local charities and support educational programs for young women interested in engineering. I consider it my way of giving back to a community that’s given me so much.

To all my fellow women in construction and those aspiring to enter the field, remember that every brick we lay today is part of the foundation of a brighter future. Stay strong, stay committed, and never doubt your capabilities.

Here’s to many more years of building dreams into realities!

I’m Saido Kishuni, and lately, I've been reflecting on the convergence of my personal and professional life. At 74, I find myself in a unique position as a construction manager here in Idaho. While many of my peers are well into their retirement, I still derive a lot of fulfillment from my work.

My late husband, John, who passed away seven years ago, was a huge part of my life and career. We met during my early years in the field, right after I graduated with my Bachelor's degree. His support was immense, and it was his encouragement that steered me into project management.

Our son, Marcus, is now stationed overseas with the US Navy. He's one of the reasons I stay connected to my roots here in Idaho. He used to help me at job sites during his school breaks, and seeing him grow into a disciplined man of honor has been one of my greatest joys.

Professionally, every day still offers its challenges and delights. The construction industry is not what it used to be when I started all those decades ago. But the core principles of leadership, problem-solving, and liaising with diverse teams remain unchanged.

Balancing life as a widowed woman can be tough, but my work keeps me anchored. My greatest pride comes from the skyline I’ve contributed to and from mentoring younger women entering the field. Passing on the baton is my way of honoring John and ensuring our legacy continues.

Looking forward to connecting with more of you and hearing your stories.

Warm regards,

My grandson, Liam, turned 1 yesterday, and it was a heartwarming celebration! Looking at him, it’s amazing how time flies by. Being a grandmother at 74 has its perks, especially when you get to spoil the grandkids and then pass them back to their parents!

After getting back to Idaho from Oregon, where my daughter and her family live, I felt a renewed sense of gratitude. My late husband, John, would’ve loved this moment. Managing construction projects across the state keeps me busy, but moments like these remind me what it's all for. 

Every day at the job site, I meet so many hardworking folks. Many of the young ones look up to me for advice, and I always think about how much my own experiences from my Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering have shaped my career.

To my friends from our tribal community, thank you for the support and love you’ve shown me over the years. We’ve been through a lot, and I wouldn’t be here today without you. Who else is looking forward to our next gathering?

I'm excited to share a milestone in my career and personal journey. For over 30 years, I've dedicated myself to the financial sector, and today, I feel immensely proud to reflect on both my professional and personal growth. Currently, I serve as a Loan Interviewer and Clerk in the great state of Illinois. This past year has been particularly rewarding, with our office helping over 500 clients secure their financial futures.

My path began straight after completing high school, and I’ve navigated through various roles in the industry, each shaping me into the professional I am today. Born and raised in the United States, specifically emerging from the vibrant Hawaiian community, I carry my native heritage with immense pride and it has influenced my approach to life and work profoundly.

While life has its ups and downs, as my divorce last year reminded me, I’m grateful for the opportunity to focus on personal development and deeply invest in my career. With an annual income of $46,740, I strive to make every contribution at work count. Whether it's preparing loan documentation or assisting clients with the intricacies of their financial needs, the satisfaction comes from knowing that my work can make a real difference in people’s lives.

One of my key accomplishments this year has been streamlining our loan processing times, cutting it down by almost 20%. This improvement is not just a reflection of hard work but also the supportive team environment and the continuous learning culture we foster at our office.

Outside of work, my favorite escape is indulging in the peacefulness of Illinois' renowned forest preserves, where you’ll often find me on early morning hikes. This connection with nature helps me stay grounded and rejuvenated.

Here’s to another year of challenges, growth, and triumphs. I look forward to connecting with colleagues, both old and new, to share insights and opportunities for mutual growth. If you’re ever in the Elk Grove Village area, I’d love to grab a cup of coffee and chat about our shared experiences.

Warm regards,

Hey Reddit,

It's Rookmin Bootwala here. Just wanted to share a bit about my journey and maybe connect with some folks who have had similar experiences. I'm a 57-year-old Native Hawaiian who has spent the last three decades in the heart of Illinois. Life here has been quite the ride, and it feels good to pause for a moment and reflect.

I currently work as a Loan Interviewer and Clerk—a job I fell into shortly after finishing high school here in the U.S. My path hasn't always been straightforward, though. I had been married once, but now I'm divorced. It’s been a few years since the split, and figuring out life in your late 50s while being single again has brought its own set of challenges and surprises. 

I earn $46,740 a year, which is enough to get by, but I'll admit I do miss the stability that a dual-income household used to bring. I think a lot about how much life has changed since those high school days. Back then I wouldn't have imagined I'd end up as a loan officer far from the sandy beaches of Hawaii. 

Anyone else find themselves reflecting a lot these days? Whether you’re navigating a new beginning, figuring out life solo, or just trying to make sense of it all, I’d love to hear your stories. 

Mahalo for reading.

My 35 years in this industry have taught me more than any textbook ever could. I'm proud to say that despite the ups and downs, I've managed to build a decent life here in Illinois.

Tomorrow, I'll be heading to the park not too far from home for a little R&R. There's a certain peace I find near Lake Michigan that reminds me of my childhood growing up on the islands. Even though I'm far from Hawaii now, those memories never fade. They're especially vivid as I think about how different life turned out from the time I walked the stage for my high school diploma.

Divorced life has its moments. Some good, some bad. But it gave me a chance to focus on myself and get to where I am today. My two children, both grown and thriving in their own right, are a testament to the incredible journey I've been on. Proud dad moments never get old.

Hello LinkedIn community!

I hope everyone is doing well. I wanted to take a moment to share a milestone that I recently achieved in my career as a Power Plant Operator here in beautiful North Dakota.

Having graduated with a Master’s degree and entering a demanding profession, I knew it would be a challenging journey. I have been navigating the intricacies of this field for several years now and I feel proud to say that it has been both rewarding and fulfilling. Last week, I received recognition for my efficiency and contributions to our plant's safety protocols. This has been a huge moment of professional pride, especially considering the hard work I’ve put in since joining the workforce.

On the personal front, it has been a journey marked by significant highs and heartbreaking lows. After losing my husband, my professional life became both a source of solace and strength. The support from my colleagues has been incredibly heartwarming, and it's moments like these that remind me of the importance of a supportive work environment.

North Dakota has been a wonderful place to live and work, offering me the tranquility I need while also presenting numerous professional challenges that help me grow. My Cuban roots have always made me value resilience and community, and those values have been pivotal in shaping my career and personal life here.

Thank you to my network for all the support and encouragement. Here’s to continuing to work hard and reach new heights!

Best wishes,
Ramdial Sahadat

Hey everyone,

I'm feeling a tad introspective today and thought I'd share a bit about my journey. North Dakota's endless plains and biting winters have a way of making you reflect. I work as a power plant operator out here, but my journey started much further away.

I was born in beautiful Cuba, a place where the sun kisses your skin and the music makes your soul dance. Life brought me to the U.S. when I was young, and I've been living in North Dakota for several years now. The contrast between the warm, vibrant streets of Havana and the cold, quiet expanses of North Dakota couldn't be greater, but both places have a special spot in my heart.

I completed my Master’s degree a few years back, which wasn’t easy while working full-time, but the satisfaction of earning that degree was worth every late night and early morning. Education has always been vital to me, especially having grown up seeing my parents work so hard just to provide basic necessities.

After completing my degree, I took up a position as a power plant operator. It’s a demanding job, but I love the sense of responsibility and the knowledge that I’m contributing to something bigger. Plus, it pays quite well, which is a relief since I'm currently the sole provider in my household.

I've faced my share of challenges, the most profound being the loss of my husband a couple of years ago. Navigating life without him has been painful and confusing. We were supposed to build our future together, and now I'm trying to figure out how to rebuild it alone.

Many people wonder why I remain in North Dakota despite the hardships, but there's something grounding about this place. The long stretches of land mirror my sense of longing and loss, yet they also offer a sense of peace and solitude that I need right now.

To those who are dealing with grief or loss, know that you’re not alone. Lean on your work, your community, or even strangers online. Sometimes, sharing helps lighten the load, even if just by a little.

Thanks for listening.

I hope everyone is doing well. I wanted to share a bit about my journey and some thoughts on resilience. My name is Koteswara Elhamshary, and I've dedicated over three decades of my life to protecting and serving our community here in Colorado. As a Native Hawaiian, born in the United States, I've always carried my heritage close to my heart, which has been a tremendous source of strength for me.

Currently, I am working as a Protective Service Worker, a role I find incredibly rewarding. This position requires not just physical vigilance but also a profound commitment to safeguarding the emotional and psychological well-being of those I serve. With an Associate degree under my belt, I've relied on continuous learning and practical experiences to improve and adapt to evolving challenges in our field.

Although my personal life has had its ups and downs—I'm currently separated from my spouse—these experiences have further fueled my dedication to my work. Being in a challenging personal space has allowed me to channel my energy and focus into my job, where I earn $37,220 annually. It’s not always easy, but I believe that every individual I help makes the effort worthwhile.

Professionally, I'm driven by the promise of creating a safer environment for everyone. Whether it’s a busy Thursday night or a quiet Saturday morning, being in service to my community has been a cornerstone of my life. Colorado has been home for many years now, and it's the place where I’ve witnessed so many individuals and families come together in times of need.

Being separated has given me a new perspective on empathy and understanding, two qualities that are indispensable in my line of work. I am continually inspired by the resilience of the people around me, and it reaffirms my commitment to my role. This journey has shaped me in incredible ways, and I am eager to keep growing both personally and professionally.

Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts. Let's continue to support each other and work towards a safer, more resilient community.

Best regards,

I've been doing some reflecting recently and thought I'd share something that’s been on my mind. My name is Koteswara Elhamshary, and I'm a 56-year-old Native Hawaiian living in Colorado. I've been working in the protective services field for quite some time now, and let me tell you, it’s been a rewarding yet challenging journey. I’m currently separated, and that, combined with my job, gives me a unique perspective on life.

I moved to Colorado a few years back after finishing my Associate degree. The change in scenery from the islands to the Rockies was pretty drastic, but the beauty of the mountains has its own kind of magic that captured my heart. There’s something grounding about stepping out into the snowy wilderness after a long week.

For those of you curious about the professional side of things, I work as a protective service worker. It’s not the kind of job you hear about every day, but it’s crucial nonetheless. We deal with all sorts of situations, making sure things don’t escalate and ensuring safety. The work can be intense, but knowing I'm making a difference keeps me going.

With an annual salary of $37,220, it’s not exactly rolling in dough, but it’s enough to get by comfortably in a state where cost of living isn’t sky-high. Plus, I’ve gotten pretty good at finding free or inexpensive ways to enjoy myself. Hiking, for example, has become a beloved pastime. The trails here in Colorado are phenomenal, and it’s a great way to clear my mind.

As someone who was born and raised in the U.S., but with deep Native Hawaiian roots, I often find myself bridging two very different cultures. It's a bit nostalgic thinking about the ocean and Hawaiian traditions while living amidst snowy peaks. It’s an interesting mix that shapes who I am today.

Anyway, I just wanted to reach out and share a bit about myself. Sometimes it feels good to put things out there, y'know? If anyone’s in a similar boat, dealing with a job that demands a lot or experiencing the changes life throws at us, feel free to drop a comment or message. Always up for a good chat or swapping stories.

Mahalo!

Just wanted to share a bit of what's been going on in my world lately. My new assignment with the protective service team has been keeping me on my toes. With the recent change in my relationship status, I'm finding new ways to adjust, focus on work, and enjoy life here in Colorado.

Being a 56-year-old Native Hawaiian in a place like Colorado has been an interesting mix. The scenery is so different from what I grew up with, but it's beautiful in its own way. Last weekend, I took a drive to Mt. Evans Scenic Byway, which felt like a breath of fresh air and a bit of an escape from the hustle of everyday duties.

I’m also diving back into some hobbies I used to enjoy. Started revisiting some of my old Hawaiian recipes, and it’s been a blast sharing them with some of my new friends here. They’re always curious when I tell them stories about my upbringing on the islands.

For those who don’t know, I’ve had quite a journey through life – from earning my Associate degree to now working diligently in protective services. It’s been a rewarding career, especially considering the fulfillment and stability it brings. And yeah, the annual salary of $37,220 might not seem like a lot, but it’s enough to keep things steady.

Looking forward to hearing what’s new with all of you too!

As I reflect on my journey, I feel a deep sense of gratitude and accomplishment that I would like to share with you all. My name is Mitsuo Vashist, and I have dedicated over five decades of my life to the food processing industry. At 72 years young, working in this field has not only provided me with a sense of stability but also allowed me to contribute meaningfully to the community here in Iowa.

I was born and raised in the United States, and after earning my Associate degree, I embarked on a career that has seen the evolution of food manufacturing processes and techniques. Currently, I work as a Food Processing Worker, and I am proud of the role I play in ensuring that families receive quality food products on their dining tables.

My journey has been one of resilience and strength, especially after losing my beloved spouse. Navigating through the challenges of being widowed has taught me the importance of perseverance and hard work. I earn a humble $35,430 annually, which has been sufficient to support my needs and contribute to the community initiatives I care deeply about.

At this stage in my life, I often reminisce about the moments that have shaped me. It's amazing to think back to when I completed high school and the eagerness with which I pursued my higher education. Now, I encourage younger generations to remain steadfast in their pursuits and never underestimate the power of their contributions, regardless of the industry they choose.

In closing, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to my colleagues, mentors, and everyone who has been a part of my professional journey. Here’s to many more years of service and growth. Let's continue to uplift each other and create a legacy that transcends generations.

My name is Mitsuo Vashist, and I recently turned 72. Life has its ups and downs, but I have to say, working as a food processing worker here in Iowa has been quite a journey. 

Originally from Iowa, I've spent my entire life in this beautiful state, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. After receiving my Associate degree many years ago, I found a fulfilling career in food processing. It's not glamorous, but it pays the bills—$35,430 a year—enough to keep me comfortable in my cozy little home. Losing my husband a few years ago was tough, but my job gave me something to focus on and a reason to get up in the morning.

I love the sense of community we have here in Iowa. In my spare time, I often volunteer at local food banks, giving back to the community that has supported me through thick and thin. My late husband and I were always passionate about helping others, and continuing this tradition keeps his spirit alive in my heart. 

Cooking is my therapy. A good weekend for me is one spent in the kitchen, whipping up soul food that reminds me of my roots and the stories my grandmother used to share about her own life. If you're looking for an amazing gumbo recipe, I'd be more than happy to share!

Now, more than ever, I've found solace in small, everyday moments. Walking through the fields during summer, listening to the birds, and feeling the texture of the earth beneath my feet. So, if life seems tough, remember to take a moment and appreciate the little things. They really do make all the difference. 

Stay kind and stay strong, Reddit family. Always here if you need a chat.

As I was thumbing through old photo albums, I came across pictures from our first family trip to Yellowstone National Park. My late husband and I took our boys there back in '83 when they were still so young and full of energy. It's hard to believe that was nearly 40 years ago. Now, Michael is running his own business in Des Moines, and Daniel has settled down in Cedar Rapids with his lovely wife Cynthia and their two beautiful kids. I miss those simpler days, but it's heartwarming to see how their lives have flourished. 

Looking back, I'm grateful for the career that's allowed me to provide for my family even after losing my beloved back in '92. Working at the local food processing plant all these years hasn’t always been easy, but it's been worth it to ensure Michael and Daniel could have the opportunities I wanted for them. Now, in my 72nd year, as I continue my routine at the plant, I find joy in the little things, like our Sunday dinners where the whole family comes together again.

Hello LinkedIn Community,

It’s a reflective morning here in Ohio, and I wanted to take a moment to share some of my journey with you. Teaching Sociology at a post-secondary level has been a cornerstone of my life and career. After proudly completing my professional degree, I was eager to dive into the world of academia and research. It brings immense gratification to shape young minds and contribute to societal understanding.

This passion for sociology isn't born in isolation but is influenced by my life's experiences. As a 61-year-old Black man, I’ve seen and lived through significant shifts in our social fabric. These lived experiences enrich my teaching and offer my students a deep, first-hand perspective on many of the topics we explore in class, from systemic inequality to cultural dynamics.

Balancing my professional life while being widowed presented its own unique set of challenges and growth opportunities. My late wife was my rock, and her support was pivotal during the initial stages of my teaching career. I often share her wisdom with my students – lessons that transcend textbooks.

Now, earning $90,200 annually allows me to contribute to various research projects and community outreach programs. These initiatives are close to my heart, aiming to make a real-world impact beyond the classroom. My dedication to sociology extends beyond teaching; it's about fostering a community that thrives on understanding, empathy, and change.

This year, I’m excited to announce a new mentoring program I’ll be leading, aimed at guiding young Black scholars in navigating higher education. Our first gathering is set for next month, and I can’t wait to meet and inspire the next generation of sociologists.

Thank you, everyone, for being part of this journey. Your support and engagement mean everything to me, and I look forward to continuing to share and connect with this wonderful community.

Warm regards,

Boodram Adrar

It's been a reflective Sunday for me, so I thought I'd share a bit about my journey. My name is Boodram Adrar, and I've been a Sociology teacher at a postsecondary institution here in Ohio for the past 30 years. Teaching has always been my passion, and I love engaging with students about social dynamics, inequalities, and cultural shifts. At 61 years old, I've seen quite a bit and shared countless lessons with the bright minds of our future.

Life has had its share of challenges recently, having lost my beloved wife three years ago. It’s just me now, but I find solace in my work and the supportive community around me. Losing someone so close is never easy, but through my faith and love for sociology, I manage to find strength each day.

My professional path began after earning my degree in sociology—a subject that’s ever-evolving and deeply relevant. Throughout my career, I've championed diversity and inclusion, pushing for programs and policies that give every student a fair shot at success. I’m a proud supporter of various local initiatives focused on bridging social gaps, especially those targeting underrepresented communities.

On a lighter note, I love spending my free time at local jazz clubs. There's something about the soulful rhythm and connection in the music that soothes me. And yes, Ohio has its share of hidden jazz gems—I might just have a few favorite spots that keep me coming back.

Feel free to share your stories or experiences about finding strength through passion. Teaching has kept me afloat during the toughest times, and I believe everyone has something that does the same for them.

Cheers,
Boodram Adrar

Today marks a bittersweet anniversary for me. It's been 12 years since my dear wife, Marlene, passed away. Losing Marlene left a hole in my heart that can never be filled, but her memory, her warmth, and her unwavering spirit continue to guide me every day.

As many of you know, my passion for teaching sociology stems from my desire to understand and connect with the vast tapestry of human experiences. I always tell my students at Ohio State University that every story, every life, is a thread in the intricate social fabric we study. Marlene was my most precious thread, weaving a pattern of love and resilience into my life.

Our two beautiful children, now grown with families of their own, are constant reminders of her. My eldest daughter just shared that she’s expecting her third child this April. Marlene would have been so overjoyed to see our family growing.

Teaching has been my anchor. Ever since I completed my professional degree and started this journey, I've found solace in the classroom. I've always believed that our personal experiences influence our teaching, and I strive to bring a piece of my history and Marlene’s unwavering curiosity about life to every lecture.

It’s a quiet evening here in our Ohio home—a home filled with memories of laughter, love, and learning. As I prepare for another week of teaching, I am reminded of Marlene’s favorite quote from Maya Angelou: ""People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel."" I hope to leave that kind of lasting impact on my students just as Marlene did on me.

Thank you all for being part of this journey. Your support and kindness mean the world to me. Let’s cherish our loved ones and keep their memories alive in our hearts.

Warm wishes,

Boodram Adrar

I wanted to take a moment to share a bit about my professional journey and what motivates me every day. As some of you may know, I’ve been working diligently in my role as a Refractory Materials Repairer, except Brickmasons, in the vibrant state of New Mexico. This line of work, although demanding, has brought immense satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment over the years.

Having completed my Associate degree some decades ago, I’ve been immersed in this field long enough to witness significant advancements and changes. My late husband always supported my career, and though it's been a while since he passed, his encouragement continues to inspire me to excel in my profession. 

Earning $51,010 annually, I’ve been able to maintain a stable life here in the Sunbelt state, focusing on both my personal growth and professional contributions. Our community in New Mexico is incredibly supportive, and I find great joy in engaging with my neighbors and colleagues.

Bringing over 40 years of hands-on experience, I’ve honed skills that ensure the safety and efficiency of the refractory systems we depend on every day. To my fellow professionals, whether you’re just starting out or mid-career, I encourage you to remain passionate and curious—there’s always more to learn and innovate.

Let’s continue to support and uplift each other in this ever-evolving industry. Feel free to reach out if you want to connect or exchange ideas. Together, we can forge a path to greater safety, efficiency, and sustainability in our profession.

Just wanted to share a bit about a new project I've been working on. After losing my dear husband five years ago, I threw myself into work to keep myself occupied. I'm 61, and while it sounds cliché, diving into my job as a Refractory Materials Repairer has been quite the journey. Repairers like me ensure everything runs smoothly in industrial environments, especially places dealing with high-temperature materials. Yep, all those scorching kilns and furnaces - that's my domain!

I'm living in New Mexico, surrounded by beautiful desert landscapes. With my Associate's degree in hand, which I earned way back, I've been able to carve out a good career. It’s not just about the $51,010 I make annually; it's the satisfaction of keeping those industrial engines purring.

While I miss my husband every day, I find solace in the rhythm of my work and the amazing sunsets here. Also, weekends are often dedicated to visiting old friends and fellow crafters in Albuquerque. We share stories, recipes, and sometimes, just a comforting silence.

Life's not always easy without him, but community and craft keep me buoyed. Anyone else find healing through their work or have a special weekend routine that helps? Would love to hear your stories!

Stay warm,

Sundays are special to me; it’s the day my late husband and I would explore the beautiful trails around Santa Fe. Now, it’s just me, but I keep the tradition alive, always feeling him alongside me as I hike through the stunning vistas. Miss you always, my love. 💔

Managed to snag a great deal on some gardening supplies today. My little backyard oasis in Albuquerque needs some new blooms! 🌸🌼 Gardening has always been my way of staying connected to nature, and it brings a sense of peace I can't find elsewhere.

I’m excited to share a professional milestone that holds special significance for me! As some of you might know, my journey at G & P Timing Solutions has been both challenging and rewarding. Working as a Timing Device Assembler and Adjuster for over six years has given me the opportunity to fine-tune my skills and deepen my expertise.

One of the most memorable projects I've been a part of was our collaboration with the research team at Brown University. Together, we developed an advanced timing mechanism that significantly improved the precision of experimental data collection. Growing up in Rhode Island, seeing local institutions benefit from our innovations has been incredibly rewarding.

On a more personal note, the support from my team has been invaluable, especially during a period of personal change. After my separation earlier this year, the camaraderie and understanding I've experienced at work have truly made a difference. Balancing a fulfilling career while navigating personal transitions isn't always easy, but the resilience I've developed makes each accomplishment even more meaningful.

As I continue to advance in my career, I eagerly anticipate the new challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. I’m also passionate about leveraging my Associate degree in Electronics Engineering Technology to mentor newcomers in the field—helping them navigate the intricacies of timing devices and adjustments.

Thank you for being a part of my professional network. Here’s to continued growth, innovative projects, and the strength that comes from both personal and professional perseverance!

Best regards,

I had a rough week balancing work and personal life, and I could really use some advice. My name is Yongcha Pagaduan, and I’m a 33-year-old living in Rhode Island. I work as a Timing Device Assembler and Adjuster, which can be pretty demanding, especially when the deadlines are tight. I recently finished an associate degree, and although it was tough to juggle work and studies, I’m proud of this achievement.

But here’s where it gets tricky. I’m currently separated from my spouse and trying to figure out co-parenting with our 7-year-old son, Jaiden. It’s been challenging to navigate the emotional toll while still being present for him. We recently started doing weekly video calls, and I’m trying to make sure we have meaningful conversations despite the distance.

Financially, I make about $46,480 a year, which covers the bills, but there isn’t much room for extras. I’m trying to save up for a decent vacation for Jaiden and me, hoping it’ll help us bond better during this tough time.

What I’m really struggling with is making new friends and finding a support system. Most of my old pals moved away, and it’s hard to meet new people when you’re juggling so much. Any tips on how to find a community or people to talk to in a similar situation?

Thanks for listening.

Life's been quite a rollercoaster lately! For those of you who don’t know, I’ve recently moved into my new apartment in Providence. It’s been an interesting adjustment living alone after my separation, but I’m finding my rhythm. My job as a Timing Device Assembler and Adjuster keeps me pretty busy, and it’s a blessing to have a stable income of $46,480 to support myself.

I just finished setting up a cozy little corner in my living room with some Asian-inspired décor – it reminds me of the family trips we took to the Philippines when I was younger. My parents, who are just a state away in Massachusetts, keep dropping by with homemade food to make sure I’m eating well. Gotta love them!

One of the highlights of my week is grabbing bubble tea at the charming little café around the corner. It’s becoming a bit of a routine and a great way to unwind after work. Anyone else into bubble tea? 

Also, I’ve started a new hobby: woodworking! My associate degree might be in electronics, but there's something incredibly therapeutic about working with wood. I made a small bookshelf last weekend, which is now proudly displaying my collection of classic novels. 

If any of my friends have recommendations for good places to eat or hang out in Providence, let me know. I’m looking forward to exploring the city more, and I’d love to catch up with any of you who are around. 

Take care, everyone!

Good morning, LinkedIn community!

I’m thrilled to share a recent professional milestone with you all. As a Purchasing Manager with over 30 years of experience, I truly believe that consistent learning and adaptation are key to success. That’s why I’m particularly proud to have recently completed an advanced certification in Supply Chain Management.

Marrying my high school sweetheart 32 years ago and raising two wonderful children has taught me the value of patience, resilience, and strategic planning—qualities that I bring into my professional sphere daily.

Currently leading a talented team in Ohio, we’ve successfully implemented a new procurement system that saved our organization $500K this past fiscal year. It’s moments like these that remind me why I chose this career path in the first place!

Especially when juggling personal commitments like celebrating our youngest son’s graduation from university next month, it’s gratifying to see the hard work pay off both at home and at work. If you’d like to discuss strategies or share your own experiences in supply chain efficiencies, feel free to connect. Here's to continuous growth and success!

Warm regards,

Kashiben Goindoo

Hello, Reddit community,

My wife and I have just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary, and I thought I’d share a bit about our celebration with you all. It’s been an incredible journey together, and reaching this milestone feels like a blessing worth sharing.

For our special day, we decided to keep it close to home here in Ohio, where we’ve built our life together. We opted for a quiet evening with our closest family and friends. We live in a charming house with a lovely backyard, and it was the perfect venue for our little celebration. With fairy lights adorning the trees and soft music playing in the background, the atmosphere was just magical.

I took charge of the arrangements primarily. As a Purchasing Manager, organizing and planning comes naturally to me. I spent weeks curating the perfect menu with local caterers, ensuring we had a mix of traditional Indian dishes that pay homage to our heritage and some all-American favorites that my grandchildren adore.

Speaking of my grandchildren, they were the highlight of the night, with their infectious excitement and laughter reminding us why family is so important. Our two daughters, who live relatively close by, worked together on a beautiful video montage that played during the evening. It showcased our three decades of memories from when we first met to our daughters' weddings, and now us being grandparents.

Among the many gifts we received, my favorite was a handmade scrapbook from our eldest granddaughter. It captured moments that I had almost forgotten but brought back so many emotions and made me immensely proud of the family we’ve grown.

We also had a video call with my cousins from the West Coast who couldn’t make it to Ohio. Technology has made it easier to stay connected with loved ones who are far away, and that call was the final touch that made the evening perfect.

It’s moments like these that make me reflect on life’s blessings. So, I just wanted to share our happiness and perhaps inspire someone else to take time to celebrate those little moments with loved ones. Here’s to more years of love, family, and togetherness!

Cheers,

It's incredible sharing these moments with the love of my life; we've come a long way since our high school days back in good old Toledo. The kids, Aarav and Mira, insisted we take some time off, and I'm glad they did. They even surprised us with a dinner reservation at a fancy restaurant overlooking the falls.

As I reflect on my career, I'm filled with gratitude for the journey that has brought me here. Working as a Water and Wastewater Treatment Plant and System Operator has been both challenging and fulfilling. For those of you who might not know much about the field, it's all about ensuring that our communities have access to safe, clean water – a mission that I take very seriously.

My name is Saravanan Mirajkar, and I’ve been dedicated to this profession for over three decades. It feels like just yesterday that I was awarded my professional degree. To this day, I'm passionately driven to uphold the environmental and public health standards that our society relies on.

Living in Massachusetts has been a blessing. From the vibrant energy in the financial district to the serene beauty of Jamaica Pond, I find inspiration all around me. My wife and I often spend weekends exploring the rich history and stunning landscapes of New England. This region's commitment to environmental preservation resonates deeply with my professional values.

I am proud of my work and the team I collaborate with daily. Together, we oversee the intricate processes that keep our water safe, something I believe is a cornerstone of public health. It isn’t always easy, but knowing that our efforts contribute to the well-being of thousands keeps me motivated.

Looking ahead, I am enthusiastic about the advancements in technology and practices within our industry. Continuous education and adapting to new methodologies are keys to ensuring our systems remain effective and efficient. It’s fascinating to see the innovations that are coming into play, which promise to make significant impacts.

Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts. I am always eager to connect with fellow professionals and share insights on how we can continue to improve our practices for the betterment of our communities.

Warm regards,

It's been one of those weeks where you need to remind yourself why you love what you do. For those who don't know me, I’ve been in the water and wastewater treatment game for quite a while now—almost 30 years to be precise! The technical challenges and satisfaction of knowing I'm helping the environment have kept me engaged. But let’s be honest, it can be a grind sometimes.

Back in the day, right after I finished my degree, I got into this field kind of by accident. Who knew a series of coincidences would turn into a lifelong career? If you had told me during my senior year of high school that I’d end up here, I would’ve probably laughed it off. Now, Massachusetts couldn't feel more like home, even though my roots reach far across the Pacific. 

I often get asked how I balance such a demanding job with family life. Well, let’s say my wife has the patience of a saint—married for more than 30 years, and she still puts up with my odd hours. Our kids are grown now, but I remember those little league games and science fairs like they were yesterday. Oh, and these New England winters! Nothing like driving to a treatment plant at midnight with a foot of snow on the ground.

I do have to give credit to my favorite spot for unwinding—a park not far from a well-known university. It’s a peaceful corner where I can clear my mind after work. Funny how even in the busiest areas, you can find those little quiet spots that no one else seems to notice.

My job has taken me to interesting places, and I’ve met some incredible people along the way. Here’s to another decade of clean water and cleaner horizons!

What keeps you all motivated in your everyday grind?

Cheers,
-Saravanan

As I was making my daily rounds at the treatment plant today and fiddling with some of the advanced filtration systems, I couldn’t help but reminisce about how technology has evolved since I first started in this field. When I think about how things were back in the early 80s, it amazes me how we've moved from manual to automated systems. 

The changes in the last 30+ years in our line of work have been nothing short of monumental. For someone who started fiddling with beakers and pipes right out of high school and pursued a professional degree soon after, it's heartening to see how far we’ve come. I remember the days when wearing flannel shirts and handling manual testing equipment was the norm, whereas now, it's all about high-tech sensors and automated controls. 

You know, it's quite a journey considering I embarked on this career path right here in my hometown of Massachusetts, where I was born and raised. Loved seeing how our state's innovations in clean water management have become a model for others. 

Being married to an incredible wife, who’s seen me come home drenched in wastewater more times than I can count, has been a blessing. She’s always made sure there’s a warm meal waiting and a discussion prompt about our favorite weekend getaway to Cape Cod.

Thinking about this makes me look forward to our upcoming vacation planned for the end of the month. It's good to take a break and recharge. It’s these little joys and big breakthroughs in life that make everything worthwhile.

Cheers to progress and the journey!

Best,

I remember back when I graduated with my Master’s degree, aiming to apply my newfound knowledge in a dynamic industry. My initial days were at a small local store in Manhattan, just around the corner from where Broadway meets 7th Avenue. It feels like yesterday, yet so much has changed and evolved.

Over the years, working in various stores throughout the bustling city of New York, from the iconic Fifth Avenue to the lively Greenwich Village, I’ve been privileged to serve a diverse range of customers and learn from incredible colleagues. Retail is not just about selling products; it’s about understanding people, their needs, and providing them with memorable experiences.

Even though my relationship status changed a few years back, life has taught me resilience and the importance of personal growth amidst change. As a separated individual, balancing work and personal life, especially in a city that never sleeps, has been challenging yet rewarding. Navigating this path has also allowed me to mentor new store associates who remind me of my younger self, eager to make their mark.

Presently, as a Retail Salesperson for a quaint boutique store on the Upper East Side, I'm continuously inspired by the stories of our patrons and find new ways to enhance their shopping experiences. It's more than just a job; it's a passion for connecting with people and making a positive impact, one customer at a time.

Looking forward to what the next chapters will bring and excited about the endless possibilities in this vibrant field. #RetailLife #CustomerExperience #CareerJourney",SUVARNA FAROOQI,LinkedIn,45,Male,Asian,United States,34730,Retail Salespersons,New York,Master's degree,Separated,3

Five years ago, when I was finishing my Master's degree, I couldn't have imagined where I'd be now—a Retail Salesperson in the bustling heart of New York City. It's been quite the journey from dreams of academia to ringing up sales in a packed store at Times Square. 

I often find myself reminiscing about those days spent in the library, buried under stacks of books, savoring cups of instant coffee to stay awake. But those memories seem distant now, much like the times I used to discuss Sartre and Camus with my classmates. Now, my conversations revolve around the latest tech gadgets and fashion trends, catering to an endless stream of tourists and New Yorkers.

My life isn't without its own quirks, though. Living in a small apartment, I’ve learned to appreciate the little things, like the tranquility of a good book, compared to the never-ending noise outside my window—a constant reminder that I'm living in one of the busiest cities in the world. 

Having recently gone through a separation, I’ve found solace in my job, in connecting with people—even if it's just a brief moment discussing the durability of a pair of shoes or the aesthetics of a new smartwatch. It never ceases to amaze me how people, complete strangers, can light up your day with simple conversations. 

Financially, making around $34,730 a year has its own set of challenges when living in New York. But as I squeeze through the crowded subway at 34th Street-Penn Station every morning, I take a moment to remind myself that resilience is key. My journey might not have followed the predictable academic path I envisioned for myself back in 2002, right on the brink of a new millennium, but it's mine, with all its twists and turns.

They say New York is the city that never sleeps, and I feel like I've lived a thousand different lives here, each more exciting and unpredictable than the last. Life has a way of happening, and all you can do is ride its waves with as much grace and tenacity as possible. 

To anyone else out there who feels like their life took an unexpected turn—embrace it. Sometimes the detours lead to the most fascinating destinations.",SUVARNA FAROOQI,Reddit,45,Male,Asian,United States,34730,Retail Salespersons,New York,Master's degree,Separated,3

It feels like just yesterday I was defending my thesis for my Master's degree at Hunter College, and now I find myself navigating the world of retail sales, a far cry from my academic roots but equally fulfilling in its own right.  

Being a retail salesperson here in the heart of New York has its own unique vibrancy—one that offers both challenges and rewarding experiences daily. Interacting with customers from all walks of life reminds me of why I chose this path, even though it doesn't always align with others' expectations of what someone with my level of education should be doing. I truly enjoy the dynamic environment and the opportunity to meet so many diverse personalities.  

Life post-separation has been a journey of rediscovery as well. Reclaiming my space on the bustling streets and amongst towering cityscapes has been both a figurative and literal exercise in finding what truly makes me happy. It's interesting how a change in personal circumstances can realign one's perspective, turning routine strolls through Columbia Circle into moments of reflective clarity.  

Though life at 45 can feel like a whirlwind at times, I am incredibly grateful for my efficient little apartment in Queens. It offers me a cozy reprieve from the relentless pace of the city. Here, I have found solaces, such as working on my model trains—a hobby I've enjoyed since my days at high school, which now seems lodged in a different lifetime.  

To my friends and family who've stuck with me through highs and lows, your support means the world. Remember always to find joy in the little moments, for they often end up being the most significant.

Hey everyone,

It's Nazeema Bridgelall here, hoping this message finds you well. Reflecting on my career as a Sheet Metal Worker and the incredible journey it's been, I realized something important: the little experiences and skills we've built over decades in this trade are priceless.

When I first entered the workforce, fresh out of high school, I never imagined that over 50 years later, I'd still be so passionate about shaping and creating with metal. Working in Missouri has given me exposure to some of the most talented and dedicated professionals in the field. I've seen our industry evolve, adopting new technologies and methods, but the core of our craft—the precision, the hard work, and the teamwork—has remained the same.

I couldn't have achieved what I have without the immense support of my beautiful wife, who has always believed in my work, and my incredible team at the workshop. Together, we've tackled projects, enjoyed BBQ weekends during summer, and even celebrated the arrivals of our newest grandkids just a couple of years back.

It's the relationships we build that make our jobs meaningful. As many of you might remember from our high school days in the early '70s, teamwork and unity are principles that I held onto throughout my career.

For my fellow sheet metal workers, young and seasoned alike, never underestimate the value of your skills. Our work might seem behind-the-scenes, but it's integral to countless industries. Let's continue to innovate, support each other, and always strive for excellence.

Cheers to many more years of shaping the world, one sheet at a time!

I was reading through some old yearbooks last night, reminiscing about the good old days when I'd hang out with friends at Waipahu High. Can't believe it was over five decades ago! It's amazing how far I've come from those sunny days in Hawaii to hammering out a living here in the Midwest. Missouri has a different kind of beauty, but sometimes I miss the surf and the scent of plumeria in the air.

I’ve been in the sheet metal trade for decades now. It's a great job, and it helped me provide a good life for my family. Funny thing is, you don't see many guys my age climbing around on rooftops anymore, but I still relish getting my hands dirty and working with metal. My wife occasionally nags me to take it easy, but hey, keeps the blood pumping!

Speaking of family, my eldest showed me how to post on Reddit last month. Technology, right? Back when I was listening to Led Zeppelin on vinyl, I would've never imagined sharing my stories with strangers across the globe. Oh, and if you’re wondering, Metallica still rocks! They might not be Led Zeppelin, but they are close.

Life's been pretty steady since the kids moved out. They visit during the holidays, which is always a treat, especially when our mokopuna come running through the door. Never thought I'd get so soft for grandkids, but here we are.

Time sure flies. From the bustling streets of New York during my union days, traveling through the heart of Alabama during those long summer road trips, to settling down in the quaint suburbs of Missouri. If anyone's ever passing through, happy to share some stories over coffee or advice on good spots to grab barbecue!

Cheers to all the metal benders, old souls, and family folks out there. Keep the sparks flying!

Best,
Nazeema

It feels just like yesterday when I was an eager undergraduate student, fascinated by the complexities of the human brain. Now, with a Master's degree under my belt and a bustling practice here in New Hampshire, it’s incredible to see how far I’ve come since those days. 

I remember when I first felt the spark of curiosity in a high school biology class about 12 years ago, a curiosity that has since evolved into a lifelong passion. Completing my residency was one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences in my life; moments like delivering a breakthrough diagnosis or collaboratively solving a complex case with my colleagues are the reasons I chose this path.

Balancing professional commitments with personal life is always a challenge, but I’m lucky to have my spouse by my side, sharing the highs and lows of our everyday adventures. Our recent collaborative project with the Massachusetts General Hospital reflects the kind of impactful work I dreamt of doing during my college days.

Looking forward to more fruitful years ahead in this field and aiming to contribute meaningfully to the advancements in neurological research and patient care. Here's to the journey and the community that makes it all worthwhile!

It's wild how much can change in just a few years. I remember a little over half a decade ago when I was deep into my residency, working those brutal 80-hour weeks and barely finding time to sleep, let alone do anything fun. Fast forward to today, and life couldn’t be more different. Now, I'm working as a neurologist and living in the picturesque state of New Hampshire. Besides loving what I do, one of the best parts of my job is having a bit more control over my schedule.

For example, this weekend, my wife and I took a relaxing trip up to Franconia Notch State Park. Hiking there always reminds me of how important it is to unwind and reconnect with nature, especially when you spend most of your time in hospital settings dealing with high-stress situations.

Also, with our second anniversary approaching, we've been spending more time at local spots that have become our favorites. Whether it’s enjoying a peaceful afternoon at Portsmouth's Strawberry Banke Museum or grabbing a coffee at Riverwalk Café in Nashua, I find that making time for these activities keeps our bond strong and our lives balanced.

I guess what I’m trying to say is: don’t underestimate the power of small, intentional breaks. Whether you’re just starting your career or you've been in the grind for years like I have, find your spots and moments of peace. What are some of your go-to relaxing activities or spots that you and your partner adore?

Cheers,

Five years ago, I was balancing neurology lectures and prepping for that nerve-wracking residency match—feels like a lifetime ago. Now, it’s like I’m on a different planet. My days are filled with patient consults and intricate brain scans, and I wouldn't have it any other way. 

On a lighter note, my wife and I spent a peaceful afternoon wandering around Prescott Park again last weekend, a serene spot we've come to love dearly. It's become almost a ritual for us, and I appreciate every moment we get to spend there, away from the hustle of our demanding professions.

It's been quite a fulfilling ride since those early days, five years ago, when I took my first teaching position right after grad school. I've always been passionate about guiding students to make informed decisions about family life, health, and consumer sciences, and living in such a vibrant community like ours in Hawaii has only enriched this experience further.

Balancing my career with personal changes has also been a significant part of this journey. Adjusting to life after my divorce was no easy feat, but it has taught me resilience and the importance of self-care, lessons that I aim to pass on to my students. 

I am thankful for the support network that I have built over the years—including my colleagues and the incredible peer groups from various family and consumer sciences conferences. These interactions have been instrumental in my professional growth and have continually inspired me to innovate in my teaching methods. 

Currently, earning a salary of $89,840 supports my passion for exploring the culinary delights that our island offers and rediscovering my love for hula dancing, a hobby I had put on hold since graduating from my alma mater in California. 

Connecting with students and helping them navigate their future has been undoubtedly rewarding, and I look forward to many more years of contributing to their success. Here's to continuous learning, growth, and making meaningful impacts!

I've been reflecting a lot lately and wanted to share some thoughts with you all. It's been about three years since I finalized my divorce. It wasn’t an easy journey, but it's taught me so much about resilience and self-love. 

Being a Family and Consumer Sciences teacher here in the Aloha State has been a big part of my healing process. Every day I get to help students understand the important skills they need for adulthood and family life. When I think back to seven years ago, when I was finishing up my Master’s degree, I never imagined I would be living and working in such a beautiful place like Hawaii. The lush landscapes and the warm community here have been incredibly therapeutic.

Balancing my work at the university with my personal life hasn't always been smooth sailing. But earning around $89,840 annually has given me the financial stability to explore my passions, like hiking up Diamond Head and spending leisure time at beaches. It's these small joys that keep me grounded.

It's funny, the other day I was tidying up my post-divorce apartment and found some old memorabilia from college – it reminded me just how far I've come since my early twenties. Life truly has a way of bringing you through the fire and out into the light.

I’m curious, for those of you who have gone through similar experiences, how did you find your balance between personal growth and professional life? Any tips or stories to share?

Looking forward to hearing from you all! 🌺

Five years ago, when I was wrapping up yet another successful decade in this field, I felt just as excited about the future as I did when I first stepped into the world of agronomy back in my early twenties. Having spent the last few decades in Tennessee, it's been a privilege to witness the state's agricultural evolution and contribute to it in my own way. 

Originally from the scenic landscapes of the Czech Republic, my lifelong journey has been diverse and enriching. It’s been fascinating working with crop and soil management systems here in the U.S. after acquiring an Associate Degree back in the day. Transitioning from European to American agricultural practices wasn't easy, but it has been an enlightening experience. 

Professionally and personally, the road hasn’t always been smooth. My professional life flourished as I delved into research, improved food production, and educated farmers. On the personal front, circumstances led to separation, which wasn’t easy, but life's lessons have been invaluable.

Earning $81,250 annually has afforded me a comfortable life, and I must say, being around farms and research centers keeps me feeling youthful and vibrant. To young professionals entering the field of Agricultural and Food Science, remember that it's not just about understanding the science but also connecting with the land and the people who work it.

Body:

Howdy folks,

Just had a moment of nostalgia while sitting on the porch, watching the sun dip behind the rolling hills of Tennessee. It got me thinking back on my journey—how far I've come over the decades. It feels like yesterday I was finishing up high school, but it was actually five decades ago when my youth in the Czech Republic painted my early years with unforgettable memories.

For those who don’t know, I’m Mouloud Bachoon, a name not quite common here in the States, but it has a certain charm, don’t you think? Been here long enough that I sometimes forget the language of my childhood, but the accent sticks to your bones, doesn't it? 😊

Back then, when I was wrapping up school, little did I know I'd land in agriculture, let alone as a scientist. Completing my Associate degree felt like a huge deal then, especially moving from the buzz of Central Europe to the serene agricultural landscapes of Tennessee. 

It's been a rewarding career, and though I’m pushing 74 now, it’s still fascinating. From studying crops to ensuring food safety, it's a field that keeps you learning—and young at heart. Earned my fair share, around $81,250 a year, which doesn't seem like much in today's high-roller market, but it’s kept me comfortable.

Life hasn’t always gone smoothly, though. Relationships are complicated, and I’ve learned that the hard way. Separated now, it’s difficult, but I find peace in my work and these beautiful surroundings. 

I often think about how times have changed. Technology in farming is leagues ahead of what we imagined back in the old days. Can’t help but smile when I see young scientists today, full of innovative ideas, reminding me of my earlier, ambitious self. 

Wrapping this up, just wanted to share a slice of my life. Even at this age, there's always something new to learn, something new to see. Here's to those who keep pushing forward no matter the years behind them!

Cheers,  
Mouloud

Hope this resonates with some of you, and looking forward to hearing your own stories!

It's incredible to see how far agricultural science has come since I first dipped my toes in the field right after finishing my associate degree. Making the move from the Czech Republic to Tennessee was a huge leap, but standing in the fields, watching the crops grow, I feel it was all worth it. Makes me think about all those years growing up near the Vltava River, never dreaming I'd end up here. The pay isn't bad either, earning $81,250 a year allows me to pursue my love for classic American cars – I might just buy that '66 Mustang I've been eyeing for a while.

When I first moved to Virginia, I never imagined I'd establish such a fulfilling career as a Desktop Publisher. It's been a rewarding experience, especially for someone who started out in the lush, picturesque landscapes of Hawaii and embarked on higher education adventures in Belgium. 

During my master's degree journey, five years ago, I discovered my passion for the intricacies of digital content and the synergy it creates in our tech-centric world. The incredible mentors and diverse experiences during those years continually inspire my approach to publishing and design today. 

Virginia has provided a nurturing community and plenty of professional opportunities. I've been fortunate to work with some amazing local businesses, helping them communicate their stories effectively through engaging and aesthetically appealing digital content. Integrating traditional Hawaiian values with the technical skillsets I've acquired has been a unique and enriching aspect of my work.

On the personal front, being single has given me the freedom to fully immerse myself in my career and interests. Whether it's catching up with friends at the local coffee spots or exploring the beautiful trails that remind me of my Hawaiian roots, each day brings something new and exciting.

I'm eager to continue evolving personally and professionally, continuing to contribute to our vibrant, ever-changing field. Here’s to future challenges, opportunities, and the undeniable charm of continuous learning!

I wanted to share something from my corner of the world that I think some of you might relate to or find interesting. Five years ago, I remember wrapping up my Master's degree and feeling that exhilarating mix of relief and excitement. For me, that phase was marked by endless nights of tweaking layouts and formats as part of my coursework, which eventually led me to a fulfilling career as a Desktop Publisher. Nowadays, I spend my days fine-tuning documents, making sure every pixel and paragraph aligns perfectly.

Living in Virginia has been an adventure of its own. The vibe here is different from the beaches and aloha spirit of my native Hawaii, but I've grown to love the history and the rolling landscapes. One of my favorite things to do on weekends is taking a short drive to explore the charming small towns scattered around. Each town has its own unique character and hidden gems, just like how each page I work on needs its own touch to make it stand out.

Although I was born in Belgium, I don't remember much of it since my family moved to Hawaii when I was very young. Yet, I do sometimes wonder what life might have been like if we had stayed there. It's funny how the 'what-ifs' can creep into your thoughts every now and then.

Professionally, earning $53,390 a year isn't a windfall, but it's comfortable enough for me. Being never married gives me the freedom to focus on my career and personal passions without the added responsibilities. Plus, I find joy in the simple things – like spending my evenings experimenting with new design software or curling up with a good book.

Speaking of books, anyone here a fan of dystopian novels? I just finished re-reading ""1984"" and it struck me even deeper this time around. Maybe it's because I'm older and (hopefully) wiser.

Anyway, just wanted to throw my thoughts out there and see if any of you have walked similar paths or share similar interests. What’s the most memorable moment for you within the last five years?

Today marks a significant milestone for me! 🌺 It feels just like yesterday when I was wrapping up my master's thesis at KU Leuven and dreaming of where life would take me. Fast forward to now, I’m loving my work as a Desktop Publisher here in Virginia. 🇺🇸 From designing important documents to making layouts that tell stories, every day brings new challenges and learning opportunities, and I cherish each one of them. Although I miss the Belgian waffles and the serene streets of Brussels from my childhood, Southern hospitality has its charm too! Every weekend, you can find me hiking in the Shenandoah or exploring Richmond's vibrant art scene. 

Also, fun tidbit: I’ve recently started attending hula classes again—it’s a beautiful way to stay connected to my Native Hawaiian roots while being so far from the islands. 🌺 Have you ever tried hula? It’s incredibly soothing and brings a sense of belonging even in a new place. Can’t wait to share my progress with you all!

Reflecting on this wisdom, I find immense pride and fulfillment in my role within the healthcare sector here in North Dakota. It wasn’t always easy; it was a journey that required resilience and commitment.

I remember 26 years ago when I first started taking my steps toward a career in healthcare. Just a young man finishing high school and eager to help others, I decided to pursue an Associate degree at a nearby community college. Looking back, the long nights of study sessions while balancing part-time work were all worth it. The energy I once dedicated to my family during those years now channels into aiding numerous patients each day.

Although the path has been personally challenging - particularly the past few years - I've found strength in my work and community. My life changed five years ago when I lost my beloved partner; the loss was profound and difficult. Still, it taught me resilience and further deepened my commitment to care for those in need. This journey has shown me how vital compassion and dedication are, not only in healthcare but in every aspect of our lives.

Today, as I contribute to the well-being of North Dakota residents, I also celebrate the small victories - every diagnosis, every reassuring word, and every smiling patient. These elements together make a significant difference.

To my fellow healthcare professionals and anyone striving against the odds, remember that every step, every effort, paves the way for a healthier and more compassionate future.

It's been a long journey since I first started as a healthcare practitioner right after completing my Associate degree. As a 44-year-old who's spent many years in the trenches of North Dakota's healthcare system, I've seen a lot of changes. You might spot me at the local hospital or sometimes even community clinics, doing what I love — helping folks get back to their healthiest selves.

Being a widower hasn't been easy, but it's made me deeply appreciate the little things in life. I still remember how my late wife and I would spend weekends exploring the scenic trails around Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Those moments are some of my most cherished memories. 

Working in healthcare means my job can be both stressful and rewarding. I earn about $64,580 a year, which helps keep things comfortable. But it's not really about the money; it's about making a difference in people's lives, day in and day out.

I frequently reflect on my high school days and the pivotal moments that led me to this career. If I hadn't been inspired by a dedicated teacher who emphasized the importance of community service, I might have taken a different path. Instead, I found my calling in healthcare, and I haven't looked back since.

Being in the healthcare field in a state like North Dakota means that community is everything. The bonds we form with our patients are strong and long-lasting. It's that sense of connection that keeps me going, even on the toughest days.

Anyways, just wanted to share a bit about my life and what drives me. If anyone else here is in healthcare or has experienced similar journeys, I'd love to hear your stories too!

As I sit in my workshop in sunny California, I can't help but reflect on the journey that has brought me here. It's a journey that started from a small, tight-knit community in the Midwest. Back then, I dreamt of combining my passions for metallurgy and academia, which led me to pursue a Doctorate degree. These days, my mornings are filled with the sound of molten metal and the precision of casting—an art and science I fell in love with during my extensive studies.

Working as a Pourers and Casters, Metal, I have been fortunate to apply my theoretical knowledge to practical challenges. It's a rewarding experience, knowing that the intricate components we create play a part in various groundbreaking technologies. Though my path wasn't always conventional, my academic background has always provided me a unique vantage point, enabling innovative approaches in our tasks.

My transition from academia to the field was bolstered by the unyielding support of my family. With two children currently chasing their own academic dreams and a supportive spouse who often reminds me to take a break, life is never short of inspiration or motivation. 

To anyone out there balancing aspirations with real-life responsibilities, I can assure you—it’s the blend of both that truly crafts one's career and life story. Here’s to always learning, growing, and embracing the sparks of potential in everyday work.

Best regards,
Rukmin Lalbachan

Just wanted to share a small victory from today. My wife and I took a day off work (I usually handle molten metal for a living) and decided to finally make a trip to the Griffith Observatory, something we've talked about doing for ages. This was a much-needed break, especially since this year I've been balancing a challenging job with kids who've started their high school journey.

Visiting the observatory was like a flashback to my younger days spent in physics labs while pursuing my Ph.D. It felt amazing to connect my past academic achievements to something that fascinates the public. My youngest was particularly thrilled when he looked through the telescope and saw Saturn. It reminded me of my own excitement when I first peered into space back in undergrad. 

To add to the fun, we stopped by a popular Indian restaurant on our way back home. I got my usual chicken biryani, the spices reminding me of family gatherings back in the day. It's always great to see my kids enjoying the same food that shaped my childhood palate. 

Cheers to small family adventures that help break the monotony of work-life!

My journey through the metal casting industry has truly been a labor of love. Reflecting on this path, I recall the days of defending my doctoral thesis while my evenings were filled with the clamor of metal and the satisfaction of creating intricate castings. Balancing these two worlds felt like blending fire and intellect, much like my favorite sculpture that took pride of place in my office for years.

Life in California has its charm too. My wife and I never miss our weekend drives along the stunning coastline; it feels like ages since we settled here, soon after finishing grad school. The sights from San Diego to San Francisco still take our breath away. And no weekend is complete without our family traditions—cooking up a storm of classic Indian dishes while our two kids share stories of their own academic adventures.

It reminds me, I met an old college buddy at a conference last week; we reminisced about those early days when I started working to support my education, forging friendships as strong as the metals we worked on.

Looking ahead, I’m excited about the upcoming annual metalworkers' meet—it's a fantastic mix of catching up with peers and immersing in the latest innovations in our field. Until then, back to the grind (quite literally)!",RUKMIN LALBACHAN,Facebook,48,Male,American Indian,United States,46600,"Pourers and Casters, Metal",California,Doctorate degree,Married,3

The past few years have been quite a journey for me, and today, as I reflect on my professional and personal life, I feel immense gratitude and pride. Five years ago, I was managing the daunting task of balancing my responsibilities as a single parent while pursuing my Associate degree. The nights were long, but the satisfaction of achieving my goals kept me going.

Currently, I proudly serve as the Supervisors of Building and Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance Workers here in the beautiful state of Iowa. It's been an incredibly rewarding job, one that I have dedicated myself to wholeheartedly. My team and I strive every day to make our facilities the heartbeat of our community.

Born and bred on the lush islands of Hawaii, my heart often yearns for the sound of the ocean waves and the embrace of the warm sun. Nonetheless, Iowa has become a second home, a place where I have built a fulfilling career and where my late spouse and I raised our family. 

Our little circle has faced its fair share of ups and downs, especially since I became widowed. Navigating life without my partner has been a challenging chapter, but it has also been a time of immense growth and reflection. The spirit of Aloha, the culture of my roots, continuously inspires me to push forward, embracing life with resilience and an open heart.

Earning $50,980 annually might not place me in the highest income bracket, but it certainly provides a comfortable life that I am grateful for. I believe in the value of hard work and dedication, principles that were reinforced during my years in high school and later during my college days.

To all my fellow professionals, whether you're just starting your journey or somewhere in the middle like myself, remember that perseverance is key. Life may take unexpected turns, but every path can lead to extraordinary opportunities. 

Looking forward to connecting and sharing more experiences with this wonderful community.

I've been kinda reflecting on my life lately and thought I'd share some thoughts here. It feels surreal to be 35, managing a great team of building and grounds cleaning and maintenance workers. It's been a long journey since I finished my associate degree - can't believe it's been nearly a decade and a half since those college days. Iowa’s home now, but sometimes I miss the waves and warmth of Hawaii, where I grew up playing on the beaches and learning about my culture.

Work keeps me busy, but I still find time to enjoy the simple things - like gardening or catching a game. Anyone else find solace in tending to a small garden after a busy week? I’ve turned my backyard into a mini oasis, complete with some native Hawaiian plants. It’s been quite the project, but it's also wonderfully therapeutic.

Being a widow has been tough; losing my partner felt like losing a part of myself. But, life goes on, and I’ve found strength in my work and community. It's like my team and my plants are my family now. The responsibilities can be heavy, but it's also rewarding to see things grow, both in people and in nature.

Do any of you have similar stories or hobbies that keep you grounded? I guess I just wanted to reach out and see if there are others out there finding peace in the everyday tasks of our lives.

Hope you all are doing well! As the seasons change here in this beautiful state of Iowa, I always find myself reminiscing about how far I've come. It's hard to believe that it’s been almost 18 years since I first set foot on this journey as a Supervisors of Building and Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance Workers. 

The early days were tough, and I often think back to those late nights I spent studying for my Associate degree while working. Balancing school and work wasn’t easy, especially when you're young and freshly grieving. For those who might not know, I was widowed quite early in life, and it’s something that has shaped who I am today. My late wife was my rock, and there isn’t a day that goes by when I don’t think of her.

My career has indeed dwarfed any expectations I might have had. Earning $50,980 might seem modest to some, but for me, it’s a testament to hard work and perseverance. Even though I moved away from my native land of Hawaii, the islands have never left my heart. It’s funny how much you miss the ocean breezes when you’re surrounded by cornfields and the flatlands of the Midwest.

On weekends, you might spot me wandering aimlessly in the local parks or biking along the trails, usually stopping midway to listen to a good mix of reggae and country tunes. It might sound like an odd combination, but it keeps me in touch with my roots and the community I’ve come to love here.

I cherish the little moments, like catching up with old friends over a coffee or visiting the farmers' market early on Sundays. These are the things that make life in Iowa feel like home. And it’s these moments that keep me grounded and remind me that no matter where life takes you, it’s the journey that matters.

Take care, everyone. Feel free to shoot me a message if you want to catch up or share some good vibes!

Greetings, LinkedIn Community!

As I reflect upon my journey of seven decades, I am reminded of the transformative power of adaptability in our ever-evolving field of telecommunications. Recently, while testing new communication protocols near the intersection of Orchard and Locust in Boise, a wave of memories washed over me, from my early days of studying Operating Systems at a time when floppy disks were the height of technology, to now experimenting with 5G networks and advancements that felt like science fiction not too long ago.

Being a Communications Equipment Operator has been both challenging and rewarding. I’ve navigated through various tech revolutions, all while putting to good use the Bachelor’s degree I earned many moons ago in the northeastern part of the country. Here in Idaho, I continue to thrive on the excitement of integrating the latest technology to enhance our communication systems. Employers might know me from my days at the call center in Pocatello where I first learned the ropes, and where my career really took off.

These experiences have reinforced the importance of continuous learning and flexibility, qualities I’ve also imparted to the trainees and younger professionals I’ve had the pleasure of mentoring over the years. On a more personal note, this adaptability has also helped me navigate my way through life’s other complexities, such as my recent journey through separation, reminding me that personal growth and professional growth often go hand in hand.

Looking forward to engaging in more insightful conversations and collaborations with this wonderful community.

Best,
Sumintra Surujnarine

I’m a long-time lurker but decided to engage a bit more recently. Just wanted to share a piece of my life and see if anyone can relate or offer some advice. Being a 70-year-old American Indian male, separated and living in Idaho can feel pretty isolating sometimes. I've been working as a Communications Equipment Operator for what feels like forever, and while it’s been a stable gig, it’s not exactly a passion of mine. 

I finished my Bachelor's degree many moons ago - don’t even get me started about how different college was back then! The pay is decent at $37,870, though I sometimes wonder if it might have been more if I’d ventured out of Idaho sooner. 

Massachusetts is home, although it's been quite a while since I left. I miss the seafood and the ocean smells—much different from the landlocked terrain here that I've somewhat grown accustomed to. I’m currently residing near what locals call 'Little Italy', a quaint section in town that has become my solace for its divine cuisine and community spirit.

As for hobbies, I’m a bit of a history buff. Can't get enough of reading about significant moments and figures that shaped our world. And more than anything, I love reminiscing about the roads less traveled in the deep woods around the Snake River. There’s just something so grounding about those places.

Navigating this new chapter of life after separation hasn't been easy. Got any tips on joining social clubs or activities for someone my age? All suggestions are welcome!

Thanks for reading. Looking forward to hearing from some of you!

Today was one of those reflective days that come unexpectedly but leave a lasting impression. I spent my morning reminiscing about my earlier years while enjoying some peace and quiet at the local park. Being a communications equipment operator has its own rhythm, but these moments of tranquility balance the frequencies of my life. 

Later, I stopped by my favorite little cafe on the corner of Harmony and Elmwood for a strong cup of coffee; the barista calls me by name now, and that simple gesture brings warmth to my heart. Also, I've been diving back into some old hobbies, just like when I used to repair vintage radios in my garage—which probably hints at my love for all things communication-related! It’s amazing how fixing something with your hands can give you so much satisfaction.  

I'm also pondering on whether to visit the annual festival that always brings nostalgic vibes from my childhood in the area of 16th Boulevard and the old railway tracks. It’s been a personal tradition of mine, long before anyone knew about the event.

Lastly, with a heavy but hopeful heart, I think about my separation and how it has been a journey of rediscovery. I am grateful for the unwavering support of my friends and family. I am focusing on the positives, the people who bring light into my life.

Wishing everyone peace and joy! 

P.S. The camellias are blooming beautifully this time of year, and for those wondering, they are at their best around the National Lab garden.

Warm regards,

Speaking about culturally-tailored health interventions for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities was a deeply moving experience for me.

Reflecting on my upbringing in the lush, tropical landscapes of Oahu, I realized how those early experiences shaped my commitment to community health. Now, having completed my Doctorate, I feel empowered to give back more than ever. 

Special thanks to the incredible team at Seattle Public Health – your support means the world. And to all my colleagues navigating both professional and personal challenges—know that balance is achievable. Since my separation, I’ve found immense strength in our community and the work we do.

Cannot wait to continue making strides for better health outcomes, one step at a time. Aloha and mahalo! 🌺

I've been feeling a lot lately and thought sharing here might help. Life as a Community Health Worker in WA has been a rollercoaster, especially with everything going on in the world. Being a Native Hawaiian female and working in a field where representation matters, I often find myself reflecting on my journey - particularly the days spent completing my doctorate. It was a challenging path, but worth every late night and early morning.

Now, at 28, the highs and lows of my personal life are just as pronounced. My relationship status has shifted to 'separated,' and navigating that while earning $49,900 a year isn’t the easiest. Financial stability and emotional wellness often feel like juggling flaming torches. For anyone who knows or is familiar with local hangouts off MLK Way S, you know it helps to find solace in familiar spots. Those casual strolls around the area help me decompress after lengthy workdays.

Has anyone else here in similar shoes, balancing a demanding job with a challenging personal life? I’d love to hear your stories or any advice you might have.

Mahalo for lending an ear. 🌺

Yesterday was such a meaningful day for me as a Community Health Worker here in Washington. 🌿 I had the privilege of organizing a wellness workshop over at our old friend Stone rode. For those of you not familiar, it’s really a tucked-away gem that’s become a second home to me. We covered so many essential topics, like mental health awareness and nutrition—and the turnout was fantastic! 

I'm super proud of the group discussions we had—especially because we hit a real breakthrough around balancing the stressors of life, mostly unique challenges we face in today’s fast-paced world. And seeing everyone come together to support one another just reinforced why I chose this line of work. 

Looking back, it's moments like these that make my heart swell with gratitude, not just for the community we’ve built but also for the path that led me here. As a Native Hawaiian, cultural health practices are deeply intertwined in how I see wellness and it’s incredibly rewarding to integrate those traditions into our modern lives. Mahalo to everyone who attended and shared their stories! Our wellness journey is a long one, but days like yesterday remind me we’re on the right path.

Today, I wanted to take a moment to celebrate a milestone in my journey. For the past quarter of a century, I’ve been dedicated to making our roads and highways safer and more efficient. From working hands-on with logistics at the eastern seaboard terminals to managing traffic operations here in the heart of the mid-Atlantic, my career as a miscellaneous transportation worker has been nothing short of rewarding.

It feels surreal to reflect back on my journey. Earning my Master's degree from the institution renowned near the Great Falls, I never imagined the ways it would prepare me for the challenges and opportunities in this field. It’s not only given me the expertise but also the resilience needed to navigate the perils and triumphs of this profession.

Being a Black female in an industry where representation is still growing, I’ve faced my share of challenges, but each of those moments has also been a testament to perseverance and passion.

On a personal note, my wonderful journey wouldn’t be the same without the support from my tight-knit community back home in areas around the DMV. Post-divorce, my career and the love for my two beautiful children are what keep me motivated every single day. Evening walks around the park reminiscent of the riverside views south of Custis Memorial Parkway have always provided me with solace and strength.

I am deeply grateful for the opportunities I’ve had and the amazing people I’ve worked with. And as I look forward to the years ahead, I’m excited about the new projects I see on the horizon, the teamwork and innovation yet to come, and the myriad ways we can continue transforming transportation for a better tomorrow.

Here’s to the next phase of the journey – making every mile count! 🌟

Hey everyone,

Just popping in to share a slice of my life and maybe connect with folks who might understand. So, I drive a lot for work, and there’s this one little diner that I absolutely adore. It's right off the interstate, just before you hit the spot where the old railroad tracks cross under. They make the best sweet potato pie I've ever tasted. It’s become kind of a sanctuary for me after long work shifts, and the staff there know my order by heart now.

I’ve been in the transportation field for a good chunk of my life, and while driving those long hauls can get lonely, it's places like this diner that make the journey a bit more pleasant. I guess it's the little things that keep you going, especially after an exhausting day. The folks who work there remind me of the community spirit back when I was studying in my graduate program. Those were simpler times, before life threw its curveballs.

Considering I’ve been through a lot, including a tough divorce, finding pockets of joy becomes essential. This diner, tucked away off the beaten path, represents a small but significant shred of serenity for me. If you ever find yourself pulling up near that intersection, maybe after a long day on the road, I highly recommend making a pit stop just to try the pie. Trust me on this one.

Hang in there, friends. No matter how winding the road might get, you can always discover a little respite along the way.

Best, JP

Just wanted to share a little piece of my life with y'all. As some of you might know, I've been working in the transportation sector for quite some time now. It's not every day you find a 47-year-old Black woman moving parts around and coordinating logistics in Virginia, but hey, it's my kind of groove. Got my Master's to thank for that, honestly. 

Still, sometimes the job comes with its own quirks. Like the other day, I was on my usual route and had to pass by that old railway crossing near Cedar Knoll Restaurant – you know the one I'm talking about if you're from around these parts. Makes me chuckle every time I see it, knowing how much of my life I've spent zipping past such landmarks. I guess working miscellaneous tasks in transportation keeps you in touch with the world in a very unique way. 

Oh, and for anyone interested – my salary needs to be enough to keep me busy between the job and a bit of online retail therapy. 😉 And while I don't dive too deep into my personal life here, let's just say, navigating life post-divorce is another kind of journey altogether. But every trip teaches you something, right?

Thanks for sticking around and sharing bits of your journey too. Here's to more roads traveled and stories shared!

Reflecting on Career Growth and Academic Pursuits

As a teenager growing up amidst the beautiful landscapes of the Volunteer State, I always harbored a deep-seated passion for knowledge and an aspiration for academic excellence. This drive saw me through countless nights studying at a little coffee shop near the iconic Sunsphere and many early morning walks to my local library down Kingston Pike.

After completing my undergraduate and master's degrees, I took a leap of faith and enrolled for a Doctorate program. Through sheer determination and numerous scholarly presentations, I was able to achieve my doctorate amidst personal challenges. It was not easy, especially after losing my partner, but I knew I had to keep pushing forward. Today, I proudly serve as a Counter and Rental Clerk, channeling my diverse skill set to ensure seamless customer service – a bridge between my academic pursuits and real-world applications.

I am now settled in this lovely state of Tennessee, a place that has seen me through various phases of my life. Alpha Beta College was my academic haven during my doctoral studies, and standing tall with an annual earning of $39,320, my professional journey is a testament to hard work and perseverance.

Being a widower has taught me resilience and the importance of community. This is why I am passionate about participating in local events at Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park, where I often find solace and inspiration to better serve those around me.

To my LinkedIn family, remember that every step of your journey adds value to your story. Academia, personal trials, and professional experiences are all sculptors, chiseling us into better versions of ourselves. Keep striving, stay resilient, and let’s continue influencing our spheres positively.

I've been in love with the local culinary scene here in Tennessee for quite some time. There's a hidden spot where I always go whenever I miss my late wife's cooking—Isa's Diner on Maplewood, just next to the old stone bridge. They have this incredible Biryani that somehow blends the flavors of my childhood and the warmth of home, even though I grew up far from here. 

Losing my wife three years ago was the toughest thing I've ever faced, but working as a Counter and Rental Clerk has kept me grounded. My days now are often filled with interacting with people from all walks of life, and it's strangely comforting after earning my Doctorate degree, which always surprises people. Not a lot of folks expect a guy with my background to end up in a job like this, but it brings a unique satisfaction.

One interesting fact: I share a lot of stories with customers, sometimes revealing a little about my Asian heritage and how I ended up in Tennessee. My parents moved here long before the history books would mention some significant events from the late 70s that shaped our community's presence in the region.

Navigating life in my 40s, especially as a widower, has been uniquely challenging but also rewarding, especially here in such a vibrant part of Tennessee close to the Appalachian foothills. Sometimes, I find solace driving along old scenic highways—somehow the journey feels like therapy.

Would love to hear from anyone who has similar experiences or recommendations on hidden gem eateries around here. It’s those small things that make life a bit more bearable. 

Cheers,
Shahzadi

I’ve been browsing this community for a while, and I thought I’d finally introduce myself. My name is Yishai Subbaraya, and I’ve lived in South Dakota for the past 20 years. It was quite a big change moving here from our family home on the Big Island. 🌺

I work as a passenger attendant, which keeps me on my feet and constantly interacting with new faces. I graduated with a Master’s degree, not something you’d see often in my field, but hey, education is never wasted, right? If you ever find yourself traveling and departing from gate C at our regional airport, there’s a good chance we might bump into each other. 🛫

Despite the chilly winters here in South Dakota, I often reminisce about the tropical breezes back home. 🌴 One of my favorite spots used to be at Lokoweh Lake, where we’d have picnics every Sunday. I guess you could say I’ve traded the view of crystal-clear waters for wide-open plains.

For anyone who understands the tranquility of a well-maintained garden, you’d appreciate the calm I find in tending to my lilac bushes and peonies. 🌸 Gardening has been a therapeutic escape since I lost my dear husband five years back. No matter how much the season changes, staying connected to nature reminds me of the vibrant energy of Hawaii.

Also, shout-out to my fellow South Dakotans! Carol's Cafe at the crossroads of High Street and Oak Lane is my go-to. If you haven’t tried their caramel rolls yet, you’re missing out on a small piece of heaven. If you visit, you might see me sitting at the counter, sipping on a hot cocoa and working on my latest crochet project.

Can't wait to engage more with this amazing community. Looking forward to hearing from you and perhaps sharing more snippets from my life. Aloha! 🌺

Working as a Passenger Attendant for our local airline, I get to see so many beautiful faces and hear fascinating stories from all over. Funny how life works, isn't it?

Losing my beloved Paul has been the hardest part of my journey. But the strength I draw from the breathtaking sunsets at Mount Rushmore and the peaceful walks in Falls Park keep me grounded. Every day is an adventure in learning and living, inspired by the warm smiles of the passengers and the rich culture of Hawaii that I carry within me.

Reflecting on my roots and the non-stop support I’ve had brings warmth to my heart. Friends, if you ever find yourselves on those flights from Sioux Falls flying west, remember to look out for a friendly attendant with a hibiscus pin on her lapel and stories of the Pacific swaying in her heart.

I often find myself reminiscing about the warm sand and surf back in Hawaii, especially during these cold months. Ah, to feel the sun on my face and hear the waves crashing at Kalama Beach Park... What a contrast to the prairies here.

Being a 49-year-old widow with a Master’s degree, life has had its ups and downs. But I’m grateful for every passenger I’ve met along the way. It’s amazing how many stories people have and how shared experiences can make the skies feel a little less lonely. 💫

I still miss you, Kaimana. Every time I soar above the clouds, I feel a little closer to the stars where I imagine you watch over me. Be safe and kind to each other, everyone.

The temperatures might plummet below zero, but the spirit of our crew remains unshaken. In my role as a First-Line Supervisor of Construction Trades and Extraction Workers, I am proud to lead a group that embodies resilience and ingenuity.

Reflecting on my journey, from completing my Doctorate and embarking on the path of construction supervision, I’ve realized the immense value of continuous learning and adapting. Leading a team through projects close to the heart of the Bakken region—a place not just rich in resources but also in community spirit—has been nothing short of rewarding. The success of our endeavors here ensures that the infrastructure supports the growth and safety of our communities, reinforcing my commitment to our industry.

To my peers in construction management, let us remember that each challenge we face is an opportunity to forge stronger connections with our teams and to innovate in ways we hadn't previously imagined. Given my 37 years of life experience and having navigated personal waters that led me to a place of growth and understanding, I believe perseverance combined with empathy in leadership can drive excellence in our field.

Here’s to building more than just structures—let’s build futures together.

Hope you're all doing well! I just wanted to share a bit about my journey, especially with those in construction and any fellow North Dakotans out there. Managing a team of skilled workers in the freezing cold months can be quite the challenge but also incredibly rewarding when you see the results shaping the landscape.

So, a little about me: I'm Ketaki Maharana, currently 37 and diving deep into the world of construction and extraction here in ND. To give you a quick mental picture of my life, imagine the serenity of a place where you can see endless plains and still feel the icy breeze cutting through in the winters. I’m originally a city boy turned North Dakotan by choice, and although I was born here in the United States, I’ve discovered a deep love for this place over the past decades.

One might think it’s odd for a guy with a Doctorate to be working in construction, but I’ve always felt more at home on the ground, supervising, and ensuring that builds meet the highest standards. The paycheck of $77,650 is decent enough, especially when I’m juggling being a first-line supervisor and managing some personal transitions in life.

Speaking of personal, it's been a journey living life separately from my partner. The adjustment hasn't been easy, but diving into work and seeing projects come to life has been my way of finding solace and meaning. Plus, connecting with the community and engaging with nature has its perks. If you're ever around this neck of the woods, think about the charm of a place where you might find folks enjoying a hot beverage at The Prairie Lodge before heading to build something remarkable.

I would love to hear from any of you in similar positions. How do you manage work and personal upheavals? Any tips on balancing it all? Also, if anybody's in the Midwest area and wants to share a drink or exchange stories, I’m always up for it.

Stay warm and keep building!

Just hit up the Icehouse bar on Main Street for some classic American bar food. If you're around the area, do give their wings a try—always crispy and just the right amount of spicy. It's great to have a spot to relax; honestly, finding good places in North Dakota can be a bit of a challenge, but this one never disappoints! 

On a related note, I've been really diving into this fascinating read on the latest construction innovations. Having finished my Doctorate in Civil Engineering a few years back, it's refreshing to see how technology continues to evolve in our field. Balancing work and research keeps me on my toes, especially with my current supervisory role. Looking forward to discussing some of these advancements with the team next week. 

Also, love catching up with my old buddies from high school. We usually meet up at the old codger’s place, Murphey Avenue, every now and then. Even after all these years and life changes, some things never change. Alright, back to unwinding and maybe another round of pool here.

I am excited to share a reflection from my journey as a Law, Criminal Justice, and Social Work professor. The autumn of life brings a unique perspective that I am keen to impart to my students at the university here in Kansas. Born and raised in this great country, I have had the privilege of witnessing the legal landscape evolve dramatically over seven decades.

One of the most profound experiences I've had was participating in a workshop at the esteemed institution off 17th and Oak, where we explored the intersections of the criminal justice system and social equity. The workshop illuminated the critical role of restorative justice in contemporary practice—an area I fervently advocate for in my teachings.

Completing my Master’s degree opened innumerable doors for me, paving the way toward a fulfilling career that now earns me the pleasure of imparting knowledge to the next generation of change-makers. Though my personal journey did not include marriage, it has been rich with professional and personal relationships that have shaped and inspired me profoundly.

I recall fondly the early days of my lecturing career, teaching foundational courses that laid the groundwork for the future professionals of our justice system. The gratifying part of my role extends beyond teaching—it includes watching my students grow and secure meaningful careers.

My income of $97,900 comfortably supports my endeavors to contribute to the community and support causes close to my heart, including advocacy for marginalized groups and improvement of mental health frameworks within our legal processes. This dedication to service is a testament to my lifelong commitment to justice and equality.

Let's continue fostering a community of shared knowledge and progressive actions. Feel free to connect if you're interested in discussions on educational methodologies, restorative justice, or social work in the context of criminal justice.

I've been reflecting on what it means to have a long and fulfilling career in academia and wanted to share some of my musings with you. As someone who has spent over four decades dedicated to the study and teaching of law, criminal justice, and social work, I've seen quite a bit of change.

Back in the '70s, fresh out of completing my master's degree, I never imagined I would be here today, still passionate about educating the next generation of social workers and legal experts. There's something about the crisp fall air in Lawrence that always brings me back to those early days, shaping the minds of young students eager to make a difference in society.

My experiences living in the Sunflower State have been deeply enriching. And yes, the local BBQ joints have been both a blessing and a curse to my waistline! I remember those endless nights grading papers and preparing lectures in my cozy little apartment just a short drive from the corner of East 14th and Connecticut. If you’re ever in the area, I highly recommend stopping by the little coffee shop there. They make the best cappuccino this side of the Mississippi.

Teaching postsecondary students has its challenges, especially on those bustling weekday mornings. But nothing beats the sense of achievement when you see students grasping complex legal principles, or when former students return to thank you for the role you played in their careers. It's a reminder of why I chose this path many years ago.

Despite never marrying, I've filled my life with plenty of ""adopted"" family—students, colleagues, and friends. My earnings of $97,900 have afforded me a comfortable lifestyle, though I’m not much of a spender. I cherish simple pleasures: a good book, a fine glass of wine, and the occasional trip to the state fair. 

So, if any of you are considering a shift towards teaching or academia, or if you're just starting your journey, my advice is to embrace the unexpected. And if anyone's up for a chat, I’m always thrilled to exchange thoughts and experiences. 

Cheers,

It’s a place full of rich memories and learning opportunities. For those of you who share my passion for the nuanced layers of social work, you'll appreciate the connection between our field and this site.

Recently, I’ve been reminiscing about the time when I first started teaching at the university, not far from the Hillside Shopping Plaza. The transformation of the area over the decades has mirrored the changes I've seen in the justice system and social work. Reflecting on this history, I can truly see the development of our society through different lenses – from educational reforms to social justice movements. 

I enjoy bringing this personal historical context into my lectures, especially when discussing case studies or legislative shifts that occurred around the time I earned my Master’s degree.

With a yearly income that still amazes my younger self, I find myself more focused on how to give back. Despite being a proud Kansan, my life here has taught me that sometimes our best lessons come from understanding the past and our surroundings – much like deciphering the intriguing local history just east of Washington Square Park, where I often find inspiration for my teaching material.

So, here's to sharing a bit about my journey and insights from working within this challenging yet incredibly rewarding field.

It's been quite the adventure navigating the responsibilities and rewards that come with being a Correctional Officer. For those who don't know me, I’m Yousry Dabwan, a passionate professional committed to reform and rehabilitation, currently calling Connecticut my home. My days are spent ensuring the security, safety, and order within correctional facilities here. Since earning my Master's degree, I've poured my heart into this role, drawing strength and resilience from experiences and challenges.

My dedication to this field stems from growing up seeing the profound impacts of criminal justice on communities. It's not just a job—it’s my mission to make a difference. Last week, while supervising an incident near Lamont Circle, it reminded me why I chose this path—to foster safer environments and help individuals on their journey to reform.

Balancing my career as a single mom post-divorce has been tough, but it’s also empowering. My son, now eight, always inspires me to stay strong and focused. There's a certain satisfaction in knowing my role contributes to making the world a bit safer for him and others.

If there’s one thing I've learned through my 30 years—ten of which have been dedicated to this career—it’s that progress is built on perseverance. To my colleagues and peers, let’s continue striving towards excellence and reform, one day at a time.

Looking forward to connecting, sharing experiences, and learning from all of you here on LinkedIn!

I never thought I’d be sharing this, but guess there’s a first for everything! So, I’ve been reflecting on some major life changes and milestones I’ve hit. Working as a correctional officer here in the Nutmeg State, managing to juggle those long, tough shifts while putting my Master's degree to good use—it’s been quite a ride. My job isn’t easy; it takes someone who can handle a lot of pressure and still maintain a sense of empathy. I know it’s not something everyone can do, but I truly feel I’m making a difference, even if it’s just one inmate at a time.

Living in CT has its perks. For instance, I love spending my free weekends at the desperate search for Connecticut’s Special Trolley once utilized in the mid-20th century. Later at the old favorite eat, something nearby the 6-mile marker along with Elm and Mason—if you’ve done your homework, you know the one! Ah, those crispy clam strips are to die for.

I’m recently divorced, which has brought its own set of challenges, but it's also been empowering. It’s given me the time and space to focus on myself and my amazing 8-year-old daughter, Yasmin. We love exploring the local parks and her new-found interest in frosty skating down at the center rink.

We talk about future goals and ambitions a lot. I want her to see that even when life throws curveballs, like the ones on top of every Red Line Stop; like Crimson’s near her art studio. There’s always a way to keep moving forward. Whether it's through education or just sheer determination, I want her to understand how important it is to keep dreaming big and working hard.

Anyone else here working in corrections, or perhaps been through a significant, life-altering event recently? How did you manage to stay grounded and positive?

Stay strong, stay curious! 🖤

Reflecting on my career journey so far, I wanted to share a little bit about my path and how it has shaped me into the professional I am today. 🌿

My journey began in my home state, where the volcanic skies of Pele often infused a sense of awe and inspiration in everyday life. After completing my Bachelor's degree, I decided to pivot towards a career where I could make a direct impact on people's well-being. Today, I proudly work as a Psychiatric Aide at a renowned mental health facility where I strive daily to support our patients' mental health and care.

Twenty-five degrees of summer sun and the occasional Razorback game truly make Arkansas a unique place to call home. Although my roots are far from the Pacific waves, I find solace and a welcoming community here—a place where my work is not just a career but a calling. 

A significant milestone recently: Celebrating my 10th work anniversary in an industry that truly requires compassion, understanding, and continuous growth. My income of $38,620, while modest, reflects my commitment to this deeply fulfilling role.

As someone who has never married, I've dedicated much of my time to professional development and volunteering at the local non-profit organization just a few miles south of I-40. This gives me a balanced life that is rich in experience and personal satisfaction.

Looking forward, my goal is to further deepen my knowledge and possibly pursue additional certifications. Whatever comes next, I am eager to continue contributing positively to this field that has given me so much.

To all my connections: Keep striving for your passions, and if you ever find yourself in the Natural State, let's connect over a cup of Kona blend!

I've been seeing a lot of posts about career changes and mental health, which got me thinking about my own journey. Working as a Psychiatric Aide in a facility nestled in the heart of the Natural State is always an adventure. Every day I get to support patients struggling with various mental health challenges, and it's truly transformative, both for them and for me.

For anyone curious about the field, it’s rewarding but also requires immense emotional resilience. I landed here after earning my Bachelor's degree and have since dedicated my life to helping others navigate their mental health struggles. The view from my window offers a glimpse of the serene Ouachita Mountains, a daily reminder of nature's beauty and healing power.

Regarding my background, I was born and raised amidst the flowing culture of the Aloha State, which still runs strong in my veins despite being far from the Pacific. Arkansas might seem like an unlikely place for someone of Native Hawaiian descent, but the sense of community here is palpable. Despite being in the South, I often think back to the warmth of my birthplace, even if only through memories of festivals and luaus seasoned with the spirit of 'ohana.

Financial stability was hard-won but achieved; I earn a modest $38,620. At 35, having navigated life's ups and downs without a romantic partner alongside me, my focus remains on personal growth and the work that fulfills me. Sometimes, I'll drive down to Pinnacle Mountain to clear my mind, a place that somewhat compensates for the absence of ocean waves.

I wonder if others have found a similarly unique path that blends their roots with newfound homes. Let’s share and learn from each other’s stories. Life's all about the journey, right?

Hope you’re all doing great. Just wanted to share a little snippet of my life lately. 

I've been finding moments of peace in the little things lately, like my early morning jogs along the Centennial Park trails. It's been fascinating, especially now when the mist hangs low and there's a calm stillness to the air that reminds me much of our trips to Hoʻomaluhia Botanical Garden back home in Oahu. I have to admit, even though Arkansas is quite different from the islands, I've found some serene spots that bring me a similar sense of tranquility. 

Work at the hospital has been quite rewarding recently. There's something profoundly fulfilling about assisting patients on their journey to recovery. As a psychiatric aide, it sometimes feels like we're piecing together small, vital parts of a larger puzzle. My education really prepared me for these challenges, and it's been an honor to apply what I learned during all those years at the university. It amazes me how far I've come since then, building a life here in this small but charming state.

Also, on a lighter note, I may have become slightly addicted to that new coffee shop off of Shackleford and Rock Creek. They do a mean pour-over coffee that’s worth every penny, and the vibe there just hits differently—I’m sure my fellow coffee aficionados will understand what I mean!

Anyway, that's my bit of reflection for today. How have you all been grounding yourselves lately? Any new hobbies or places you've discovered?

I'm excited to share a bit about my journey in the world of Painting, Construction, and Maintenance! Born and raised amidst the vibrant culture of Saint Lucia, I've always been drawn to creating beauty in even the most overlooked places. Today, I proudly call the wide-open prairies of Wyoming my home.

Achieving my professional degree was no small feat, but it has been instrumental in helping me build a career that combines both my technical skills and creative passions. Over the past few years, I've had the privilege of working on various projects across the state, from restoring historic buildings in the heart of downtown Cheyenne to more modern endeavors along the scenic landscape of the Big Horn Basin.

While the wide expanses of Wyoming might seem a far cry from my Caribbean roots, they've inspired me in ways I never imagined. Here, I've learned the delicate balance between maintaining structural integrity and adding artistic flair to otherwise utilitarian spaces. Each project becomes a canvas where I blend precision with imagination.

When I'm not on the job site, my spouse and I love to explore the local trails, finding peace and inspiration in the rugged beauty of the West. The support of my family fuels my passion and dedication in this field.

If you’re ever in the area, look for me painting murals on a friend’s café at the corner of 3rd and Sheridan. It's these little, local projects that remind me why I chose this path and keep me motivated to bring creativity and craftsmanship to every job I tackle.

As a painter, construction, and maintenance worker here in Wyoming, I often face some pretty harsh weather conditions, but this has really tested my endurance this season. Thankfully, the view of the snow-capped mountains in the distance and the occasional sighting of pronghorns make it somewhat worth it.

Can you believe the temperature can drop to nearly -20°F during winters here? Trust me, you don't know the meaning of cold until you’ve sanded scaffoldings in this weather! But hey, it's a trade-off for living in such a nature-rich and serene place. My husband and I moved here a few years back from a tropical paradise, and let me tell you, Saint Lucia's beaches and Wyoming’s Rockies are worlds apart! I'm still adjusting to trying different kinds of food. Nothing beats the spicy Creole dishes and fresh fruits back home, but there's something to be said about the local bison steaks.

Speaking of home, we recently hit a milestone milestone in our marriage–our fifth anniversary! Thanks to my job’s stable income ($49,350 annually), we're slowly but steadily renovating our little cabin. We just managed to refinish our hardwood floors, and the place is looking great. Sometimes I jot down notes about my day, reminiscing on how far we’ve come from our tiny apartment near the beach.

Weekends are precious around here. When I’m not working, you’ll find me indulging in my passion for watercolor painting. There's so much inspiration right outside my front door. Often, I lose track of time as I paint the landscape or the rustic barns scattered around. There's even this particular spot where the flowers bloom wild and free – it’s a hidden gem only the locals seem to know, and every painting I create from that spot seems to tell a story of its own.

Life can be demanding with my job, but every brushstroke I lay on canvas reminds me why I love what I do – painting, creating, and building isn’t just my occupation; it’s my soul’s calling.",AYSAR KHADOUR,Reddit,28,Female,Native Hawaiian,Saint Lucia,49350,"Painters, Construction and Maintenance",Wyoming,Professional degree,Married,4

It's been a rewarding but tough project, especially with those Wyoming winters bringing challenges. I must say the views here are something else—makes those early mornings on the scaffold worth it. 🎨🏔️

On a different note, I was reminiscing about my childhood back in the turquoise waters of my birthplace. A small island with so much warmth, it's always close to my heart. I often think about what my life would have been like if I had stayed there, but Wyoming is where I've built my life, both professionally and personally. I have my amazing husband by my side, who supports me through every new painting endeavor. 🏝️❤️

Also, just hit a professional milestone: it has been such a journey since I received my degree. I remember the days of hard studying while juggling a part-time job to make ends meet. Completing those goals felt amazing and has led me to be where I am today, earning a stable salary that supports us both. Six years ago, this seemed like a dream, but here we are, living it. Proud of how far I've come and excited for what's next!

To all my fellow painters and maintenance workers out there, keep pushing forward—dreams do come true. And for those wondering, the sweet taste of success pairs beautifully with a little ice from that popular spot just off the main road back home.

Much like the precise lines and curves we meticulously draw on our CAD software, life also unfolds with equal precision, albeit unpredictably. 

I am proud to say that my journey has not been a solitary one. Despite experiencing the profound loss of my life partner, I have managed to stitch together a tapestry of resilience and dedication to my craft. With over a decade of experience and a Professional degree to my name, I've had the honor of contributing to various projects across the state. From the breathtaking vistas near the Continental Divide to the bustling areas around the intersection of 3rd and Main in Bozeman, my work stands tall, reflecting both personal and professional growth.

Although my annual income of $60,370 might not be the highest, it has been enough to support my endeavors and maintain the quality of life that allows me to wholeheartedly invest in drafting. Each drawing represents a piece of my legacy, a testament to the detailed-oriented and determined individual that I strive to be, despite the shadows of grief. 

I am incredibly grateful for the opportunities this beautiful state provides, the tranquility of its landscapes, and the sense of community that prevails here. Montana is not just where I live; it's where I draft my future, one design at a time.

It’s been a while since I’ve felt compelled to share my thoughts here. Life has been quite a journey lately, filled with complex drafts and unexpected revisions. 

Work as a drafter has always been my escape. Today, I found myself poring over a set of blueprints for a new project in Flathead County. The precision and creativity required to bring structures to life often mirror my daily efforts to rebuild my own. Finding solace in the meticulous lines and measurements is somewhat therapeutic.

However, there are days, especially during those late nights driving down the long, empty stretches of the MT-200, that the silence becomes deafening. Since I lost my wife, every bend in that road feels like a memory waiting to unravel. We used to love our spontaneous hikes around Granite Peak. Every step up that trail was a promise of a future, one that crumbled far too soon. The trails now, however, are paths of reflection and sometimes solace.

My colleagues often comment on my dedication, unaware that diving into work is my way of coping. Sometimes, during a quiet lunch break with my Thermos coffee, I catch myself reminiscing about our kitchen conversations—the smell of fresh cinnamon rolls she used to make still lingers in my mind.

After completing my professional degree, I never imagined I’d be charting out my life in Montana, far from the bustling streets of where my roots lie. The move was dictated by love, and now, it’s sustained by memories of that love.  Also, the proximity to the 45th parallel north feels almost poetic, a midpoint between extremes, much like my life now.

Sometimes, driving past the intersection near the old mill on Harrison and 14th, I think about how my life's plans and drafts have changed, yet I continue pushing forward. Each new project I draft is a step towards healing, a new line on my life’s blueprint. It’s all part of the process, I suppose—rebuilding both in art and in life.

So, to anyone navigating their own complex drafts of life, know that it’s a minute by minute, step by step process. We're all drafting, revising, and moving forward, one line at a time.

It's been a pretty reflective weekend for me. I took a drive down to the intersection of Russell St and 11th Ave and couldn't help but feel a wave of nostalgia. I remember driving through this spot many times back in my college days. Something about the quiet streets and old brick buildings brings a sense of peace that feels rare these days.

Work has been pretty demanding lately, especially with a couple of aeronautical drafts I'm refining—those blueprints ain't gonna draw themselves! But you know how rewarding it can be when you see the final plans come to life. It's funny how the same calm that I feel at that intersection translates into my drafting work, creating precise lines and imagining sleek designs.

Having lost my other half a few years ago, it's these little moments and memories that help keep me grounded. Sometimes, when I get home from work, I find myself sitting with a cup of coffee, staring at the drafts and mulling over life.

I know Facebook isn't a place to get too sentimental, but sometimes you need to share a piece of yourself with those around you. Maybe next weekend I'll head over to Bitterroot River—it's where we used to picnic—and let the memories flow.

Hope y'all are finding moments of peace amidst the hustle. Keep going, friends.

From the bustling corridors of Stuyvesant High School, where my passion for education first sparked, to earning my associate degree at a community college known for its strong emphasis on early childhood education. The journey has been as scenic as the view across the Brandywine Valley.

Over the last three years, my role as an Education and Childcare Administrator has been incredibly fulfilling. Working in a state that values the nuances of early childhood education—known for its coastal charm and historical significance—has enriched my experience and broadened my perspective. Navigating the intersections of policy and practical application, much like maneuvering through the intricate roadways around the state's capital, I have honed my skills to drive positive change within our institution.

As an administrator, ensuring that the children under our care receive the best possible start is my top priority. From planning and overseeing curriculum to coordinating with dedicated staff, each day at work reminds me of our collective responsibility and potential as educators. It's more than just a career; it's a commitment to the future, similar to the dedication I felt during my volunteer work at the community center just a few miles from the Del. Stat. Univ.

Never married, my life is currently my work and the pursuit of continuous improvement both personally and professionally. Whether it's attending seminars near the iconic Main Street or collaborating with fellow educators to develop innovative teaching methods, every experience contributes to molding a better education system for our children.

To my fellow professionals, I am eager to hear your thoughts on new strategies for enhancing our educational environments. Let’s connect and continue this important conversation that shapes the leaders of tomorrow, while also appreciating the historical roots of our inspiring community settings.

I've been swamped with work lately, but I'm finally taking a little break to share something interesting from my hometown. While I'm deep in the thick of paperwork and managing classrooms, I find solace in the hustle and bustle of Little Italy. Yeah, you could say it's my escape from the world of lesson plans and administrative reports.

Last weekend, I treated myself to the most amazing plate of pasta and a delightful espresso at my favorite spot near 5th and Union. It's a hidden gem that always brings back memories of a simpler time, even though it's just a stone's throw away from where I now juggle meetings and supervise curriculum developments. 

To add a little spice to my routine, I've been exploring some of the lush greens at BB Ramble Park. If you haven't checked it out, you're missing out on a serene place to unwind and let your thoughts wander. I often find myself there after a long day, reminiscing about high school days and the drive to get my associate degree while balancing part-time work.

Anyway, if anyone shares the same love for these cozy nooks in our corner of the world or has some favorite local spots to recommend, let's chat! Life in Delaware’s more than just beaches and tax-free shopping—there's a thriving cultural heart if you know where to look.

Catch you all later!

This past weekend, I had the chance to enjoy some quality downtime from arranging lesson plans and setting up student activities. I decided to take a little road trip and explore the quaint delights that the intersection of Main and Highstreet has to offer. It felt amazing to soak in the rich history of our lovely state capital while sipping a perfect green tea latte from my favorite hidden gem café. Walking past the beautiful facade of the Old State House brought back bittersweet memories of that history elective I almost failed in community college—ah, the good old days!

It's moments like these that make me grateful for the work-life balance I've managed to carve out over the past few years. When you’re in the business of shaping young minds, it's crucial to take a step back and cherish some ""me-time."" Speaking of which, my cozy downtown flat is finally coming together with those floral curtains I ordered last month. They really tie the room together and bring a touch of my heritage to this charming city.

I hope you all make the time to explore the local spots that make our community so unique. If you haven’t been to the seasonal festival near the library roundabout, I highly recommend it—it’s a perfect blend of cultural richness and community spirit. Also, a heads-up, there is a free book exchange next to the big oak tree—never thought I'd see ""The Joy of Cooking"" next to ""Pride and Prejudice!""

As we head into another busy week filled with school meetings, curriculum updates, and everything else under the sky, let's not forget to take a breath and appreciate the small joys around us ❤️

Warmly,

I'm thrilled to share a recent milestone in my career. After four decades in the industry, installing and maintaining electrical power lines has been a true calling for me. Being part of the team that ensures our neighborhoods stay lit and connected fills me with pride and purpose. Even as I step into my mid-sixties, the thrill of scaling heights and solving complex electrical issues is as electrifying as ever – pardon the pun!

Career paths often intertwine with personal journeys, and mine is no exception. Having been born and raised away from the mainland, moving to the Midwest was a significant change. I've embraced the warmth of the Aloha spirit and integrated it into my work ethos here. Living now in the shadow of the Willis Tower, life's contrasts are stark but enriching. For those who pass the corner of Wacker and Monroe, I bet you can feel the energy – it's not just the cables above!

Despite life's twists and turns, including a recent transition into singlehood, my commitment hasn't wavered. The love for connecting people – figuratively and literally through the power lines – remains a constant. My professional certification has been a cornerstone, paving the way for a fulfilling career that supports my comfortable living.

This role has afforded me not just a stable livelihood but also a platform to impart knowledge and mentor the next generation entering this high-voltage field. Sharing decades of expertise in settings like the local vocational schools, especially around areas known less for skyscrapers and more for their resilient community spirit, has been incredibly rewarding.

Here’s to the many more skyward climbs, dedicated connections, and empowering others along the way!

Mahalo and stay safe,

Lately, I've been thinking a lot about life's twists and turns. I swear, being an Electrical Power-Line Installer and Repairer sure gives you perspective from up high. Climbing those utility poles and keeping the juice flowing to our homes feels both invigorating and exhausting. I’ve been at it for decades, and even though it's not a walk in the park at my age, it certainly keeps me fit.

On a more personal note, I've been navigating some emotional high wires too. You see, I'm separated, and it hasn't been easy, but it’s given me a lot of time to reflect. I remember the days back in the ’80s when I was just starting out, green as a sapling, and life seemed to stretch out endlessly ahead of me. Back then there was a place around Ashline Rd and Centurion Dr where my buddies and I would grab a beer after a hard day's work. It feels like a lifetime ago.

I live in the Prairie State now, but my heart never left the islands. Growing up on luau food and listening to the waves was a different kind of paradise compared to the Midwest. I try to get back whenever I can, but that’s not as often these days. The job keeps me grounded here, quite literally.

My paycheck is stable enough – around $82,770, which isn't too shabby, but man, some days I'd trade it all for just one sunset back in Kona. Funny how those little things stick with you, isn’t it? Anyway, I'm curious, does anyone else feel this deep connection to a place far from where they are now? How do you keep that part of you alive?

Stay safe out there, especially if you’re working with high voltage like me!

This year marks my 45th year maintaining and installing the lifelines of our modern world. It's been a long journey from when I first studied the intricacies of electrical grids and power lines at the trade school in the heart of the city where the river flows westward under the ancient railway bridge. 

Nowadays, my son has taken an interest in following in my footsteps, while my daughter is pursuing something much different in the windy city after finishing her degree just last spring. It's remarkable to think about how much things have changed, both in my profession and personally.

Reflecting on life, it's been quite the journey from surfing the waves off the shores back home to troubleshooting electrical issues in every kind of weather here in the Corn State. My roots still pull me back to the Pacific, but life’s currents have brought me to where the winter jackets are essential. 

Meeting new faces daily and reconnecting with old colleagues, I'm reminded of the bonds forged through hard work and shared experiences. To those braving the elements alongside me now and over the years, here's to the next pole and the next repair. Stay safe out there, folks.

Reflecting on my journey that started five decades ago, I can't help but feel a sense of pride and gratitude. From my early days in food processing to now, the industry has changed significantly, but the dedication and passion for ensuring quality and safety for consumers have remained constant. 👨‍🍳

Growing up in the vicinity of the mighty Zion and the red rocks of Southern Utah, I was always inspired by the beauty and resilience of my surroundings. It was this resilience that drove me to pursue a career that has provided for my family and given me immense satisfaction. 

I still remember attending cultural festivities organized by our local community center back in the day. The aroma of traditional dishes being prepared by family and friends ignited my love for food processing and sparked the desire to know what goes behind making every meal safe and enjoyable. Those were the days when my wife and I would look forward to the annual lantern festival at the Square, a tradition we continue to cherish even today. 🎇❤️

Completing my Associate degree in Food Safety while managing work and family responsibilities wasn't easy, but it was rewarding. This education enabled me to specialize in ensuring that our manufacturing processes always adhere to the highest standards. There have been long hours and countless shifts, but every successful inspection and every satisfied customer made it worth the effort.

As the industry evolved, so did I. Embracing new technologies, from the early mechanical grinders to today's automated systems, required continuous learning. Working on the factory floors located near the confluence of major interstate arteries in our state presented logistics challenges, but provided excellent opportunities for growth. 

I'm proud to share that I’ve been with the same organization for over three decades, contributing to various projects that helped us secure multiple quality certifications and awards, some of which are displayed proudly at the intersection of Main and 300 South - a testament to our team's hard work. 🏆

To the younger generation and my peers, I say: Passion, perseverance, and a love for learning keep you moving forward. The food processing industry may not be glamorous, but it's essential and deeply fulfilling. Here's to many more years of ensuring that what lands on your plate is safe, healthy, and of the highest quality!

I’ve been working the evening shifts at the plant and getting home pretty late recently. For those who grind with me in food processing, you know it can be tough, but it keeps the lights on and food on the table. A good pair of boots can make all the difference, especially when you're on your feet for hours. Any recommendations for something durable and comfortable?

Also, if any of you have tips for easing joint pain, I'd appreciate it. At 70, the wear and tear starts to show more distinctly. My wife has been giving me some herbal remedies, and they help, but I wouldn’t mind adding some more tricks to the bag. 

It’s getting to that time of year again when the snow starts building up, and I gotta admit, driving around that big clock tower ain't what it used to be. Utah winters can be beautiful but relentless. I remember trying to navigate those icy streets 30 years ago when the roads were just as tricky.

Speaking of old times, anyone remembers those mom-and-pop diners near the red rock trails before they got replaced with chain restaurants? Ah, the pancakes were worth the hike! If you still know of any hidden spots like those, give a shout. My wife and I love reminiscing over breakfast.

Let’s keep supporting each other. For all my fellow night owls, keep grinding and share your wisdom!

Today, I reflect on the confluence of personal and professional growth that defines my journey. Navigating the intricacies of human resources from a desk stationed west of the Big Sioux River has been nothing short of enlightening. Over the years, the landscape of South Dakota has been more than just home—it’s been an anchor to my evolving career in HR.

As someone who has always been passionate about fostering workplace harmony, my educational foundations laid in the mid-90s have been pivotal. A Bachelor's degree journey that commenced during the Clinton administration taught me resilience and adaptability—traits that are essential in an HR role.

Professionally, I thrive on the versatility required in my role at our firm, especially considering the multifaceted challenges I've faced. Balancing everything from recruitment drives to employee relations on the Gulf side of our office has been incredibly rewarding. My position allows me to connect not just salaries but lives, ensuring each team member feels valued beyond their paychecks.

Personally, life post-separation has been a journey. Finding solace on solitary walks at Falls Park has given me the clarity and resolve to push forward. The streets of Sioux Falls, punctuated with memories, remind me daily of the importance of both personal and professional growth.

With a salary that resonates somewhere around last year's global median household income, every dollar earned reflects a commitment to bettering both myself and those around me. It’s a testament to my 46 laps around the sun, each filled with lessons and experiences.

I look forward to connecting with fellow professionals and exchanging insights on HR best practices and life’s journeys. Let’s continue to inspire and be inspired.

Warm regards,
Divakar Pitysingh

Life has a funny way of weaving threads you never expected to be a part of, but here I am.

Every morning, I follow a routine that probably seems mundane to many. I drive past Falls Park, appreciating the tranquility it brings me, before heading to the HR department where I’ve been a fixture for who knows how many years now. My job isn't just about paperwork; it's about interacting with people, understanding their stories, and helping them navigate the intricacies of their employment.

Recently, I’ve been diving deep into our employee engagement strategies because, let’s face it, those systems aren't going to modernize themselves. Remote work has introduced new challenges, and balancing that with the bi-weekly Zoom catch-ups has kept me busier than ever. Some days, I feel like a digital archeologist, uncovering the relics of our old systems and integrating them with the new. But it's fulfilling in a way that's hard to describe unless you're in it.

My separation was an unexpected turn, but we all cope in our own ways, right? Some find solace in travel or hobbies; for me, it's been about rediscovering the city where I grew up. There's something comforting about old haunts and new spots like the donut shop that popped up by 41st and Minnesota, serving a nostalgia-laced coffee that takes me back to simpler times.

Of course, nights can be lonely in a two-bedroom apartment that used to be a home, but I try to fill the silence with the sound of old vinyl records—Stevie Wonder being a go-to—and pages of yet another sci-fi novel. Sometimes, I reminisce about college days through the faintest echo of dorm room parties long past, thinking about the Economics class that was the bane of my existence at the time.

Life on a 46,900 salary isn't flashy, but it's honest work, and it keeps me grounded. Even if the paychecks don't stretch as far as one might like, they’re enough to keep this modest life moving. Who would have thought a small-town kid would be where I am today, navigating the complexities of both life and employment in a place known more for its rolling plains than its skyscrapers?

I know the future holds something new—maybe even something beautiful. Until then, I'll keep finding joy in the routines, the discoveries, and the Little Things, like a hot meal from that unnamed food truck by the park.

🚀 Reflecting on my journey as a Metal-Refining Furnace Operator in the diverse landscape of the Big Apple, I'm thrilled about reaching new milestones and challenges in 2023! 💪🏽

My path from defending my dissertation on advanced metallurgical processes in grad school to operating sophisticated furnace systems has been nothing short of fascinating. Being part of the team that handles critical stages of metal refinement, ensuring that New York’s infrastructure gleams with the resilience of top-quality alloys, is incredibly rewarding. 🏗️🔧

It wasn't always easy juggling 12-hour night shifts and tackling issues on the production floor, but the thrill of molding raw materials into vital components has kept me going. Not to mention, the buzz of 7th Avenue and the soothing hum of the machinery work wonders in balancing the daily grind. 

I've also begun mentoring new hires from the recent batch of grads from Pratt Institute, sharing my experiences and guiding them through the intricacies of furnace operation and safety protocols. Seeing their enthusiasm brings back memories of my first week in this role - a whirlwind of learning and adjustments.

Beyond the furnace, I've been keenly following advancements in AI integration in manufacturing, and I've enrolled in a module at the local tech hub in Soho to better understand how we can leverage this tech in our processes. 🌐🤖

On a personal note, I'm navigating single life in Manhattan, which is a story of its own - let's just say that finding time for evening social gatherings amidst shift rotations is quite the balancing act! ✨

Eager to connect with fellow professionals who share a passion for metallurgy, tech, and navigating the unique rhythm that is life in NYC. Let's forge ahead together - both in our field and our lives! 🔗✨

Does anyone else find themselves missing the simple delights of childhood, like playing bao or enjoying lumpia with your family on a lazy Sunday? It's funny because while I've been metallurgically refining things all day at work, I seem to also refine memories of how nice it was to live in simpler times. Some days, the heat from the furnace isn't the only thing that makes me nostalgic. 

Also, anyone here with a Doctorate might relate to the eternal grind it took to get that Ph.D. My fellow Asian overachievers, you know what I'm talking about! Balancing it with work, especially one as intense as overseeing metal-refining operations, wasn't a walk in the park. But getting that $53,450 paycheck does feel rewarding. Still, living near the intersection where the Belt Parkway meets Emmons Avenue has its own perks, like quick sunset views by the bay - a small reward after a grueling day. 

Life as a 27-year-old who’s been proudly New Yorker-born but culturally rich in heritage offers unique challenges and joys. Plus, being single and riding the solo wave in such a bustling city has its own storylines that we all play.

Would love to connect with anyone sharing similar memories or experiences – who knows, maybe we crossed paths at a hole-in-the-wall Filipino shop around West 8th Street!

Just finished a challenging 12-hour shift at the furnace. It’s always interesting working with the molten metals and watching the transformation, but it’s definitely not for the faint of heart! 💪👩‍🏭

I took a walk tonight to clear my head and ended up at my favorite spot in the city, right where you can still smell the history of the old shipyard. It’s surreal thinking how different my life could have been if I followed my initial path in academic research. From obtaining my doctorate to now working in an industry that’s rarely associated with someone with my educational background, every single step has been an adventure.

In other news, I'm finally looking at a pay raise this year! $53,450 might not seem like much to some, especially considering the cost of living here, but it's a significant milestone for me. It’ll definitely make saving for that apartment near the iconic bridge less of a dream and more of a reality. The thought of eventually waking up to a view of the water before another long day at the forge is what keeps me going. 🌉✨

I’ve always been a bit of a lone wolf when it comes to relationships, focusing more on my career and personal growth. But who knows, maybe this year will bring new connections. Until then, it’s just me, my work, and the city that never sleeps.

Cheers to all the strong, driven women out there breaking barriers in male-dominated fields! Keep inspiring and shining. 🌟

With over four decades in the realm of electrical and electronic assembly, I reflect on my journey with a profound sense of accomplishment and adaptability. I recall the bustling days at the intersection of Van Buren and Seventh where I honed my craft, and it's the memories of those intricate wiring systems and circuit integrities that fuel my passion even today.

Starting with just an Associate degree from a college known for its practical training in a neighboring state back in the '70s, it’s been an exhilarating ride. The rewarding experience I gain from piecing together complex electromechanical assemblies—especially in a constantly evolving tech landscape—continues to inspire me. Addressing the nuances of each project reminded me of why I chose this path; it wasn’t just for the $41,770 annually, but for the sheer love of the craft itself. 

My resilient journey mirrors the serene yet rugged beauty of my home state, Montana. It's not always easy being situated far from major tech hubs, but the challenge has only sharpened my skills. Post-divorce, I find joy in visiting familiar places like the trail along the Higgins Avenue Bridge and indulging in the peace it brings.

My engagements with my peers and the occasional mentoring sessions give me immense satisfaction, knowing that I can impart some of my hard-earned knowledge to the next generation. To all my connections, remember: it's the dedication to your craft and the persistence through every setback that eventually paves the road to excellence.

Here’s to the unending pursuit of precision and innovation!

Hey Redditors,

I was feeling nostalgic today and wanted to share a little throwback from my early days as a budding assembler. Let's just say it feels like a lifetime ago, although looking back, it's been around 48 years since I first set foot in this industry. When I first started, the big news in town was all about the Gallagator Trail finally getting completed—that seems like yesterday!

In my first role, in a small workshop that wasn't too far from the place where they now hold the famous annual Evel Knievel Days festival, I cut my teeth on basic electronics. Imagine an 20-year-old kid, fresh from his associate degree, more interested in the intricacies of wiring than the buzz surrounding the now-closed Butte copper mines.

Fast forward to now, and I draw a sense of pride reflecting on how my career has panned out. Living in a place where you're just a stone's throw away from the Yellowstone River has its perks, but I've always relied on my knack for fixing things to keep life electrifying (pardon the pun). That's probably why, even after all these years and after my divorce nearly a decade ago, my heart still clings to this line of work. Who would have thought the electro-mechanical industry could be so captivating, right?

Recently, I rediscovered schematics from a project I worked on in the late '70s. Imagine creating something so complicated without the aid of the fancy CAD software we have today—it was pure elbow grease and a lot of coffee from that old diner down the road from 8th Avenue North and Davis Street. That place is long gone now, but the memories of those long shifts linger.

Feels good to reminisce and share. Anyone else here with old-school electronics tales?

We reminisced about our days at the tech school just north of that park everyone seems to love for its summer fairs. Can’t believe it’s been nearly five decades since then. It's funny how life has woven our journeys in such intricate patterns. My hands are a bit more worn now after years of working on delicate circuits and boards, but it's still a thrill every time I get something to operate smoothly. 

Things always change, but it's comforting to know that some routines remain solid, like those Sunday brunches after our morning hikes around the hills that Montana is famously known for. I found a great deal on that hobbyist tool I’ve been eyeing for months - it brought me back to the days when I would stay up late in the garage, tinkering away while the kids were fast asleep upstairs. It’s amazing how a simple tool can hold so many memories.

They say you never really finish a project, you just stop working on it – and it looks like they’re right. Retirement is near, and maybe it’s time to pick up that dusty guitar again. Who knows?

Delaware has been home for several decades now, but when I look back at my journey from the tiny island of Tuvalu to becoming a seasoned Technical Writer here, the contrasts are striking and inspiring. Recently, I’ve been reflecting on my career while walking through the serene trails near the intersections of Lancaster Ave and Greenhill Ave, thinking of the blend of traditional Asian storytelling and modern technical writing that shapes my work today.

The path hasn't always been smooth, but each step, from navigating graduate studies to penning intricate guides for cutting-edge technology, has been worth it. And, sharing my life with a partner who loves the quaint shops near Brandywine Park and our modest yet lovely colonial-style home, adds rich textures to my day-to-day life.

To my colleagues and aspiring writers: Embrace your origins and experiences. It might seem like a long distance from the serene shores of a Pacific island to the professional demands of Delaware, but every unique journey brings invaluable insights. 

Here’s to many more years of weaving my story into my work, fostering clarity in communication, and embracing every beautiful, unpredictable twist in my life story.

Hello everyone,

I wanted to share some reflections today as I sip my morning chai. It’s amazing how time flies—one moment you’re navigating the crowded markets on an island in the Pacific, and the next, you find yourself settled in a small but charming state on the east coast of the USA.

For those who might relate, migrating and building a life in an unfamiliar land comes with its unique set of challenges. Forty years ago, I left the balmy shores where I grew up speaking Tuvaluan and wrestling with schoolwork. Fast forward a few geopolitical changes and a couple of plane rides later, I found myself in a place where crabs are practically a symbol of the local cuisine.

As a technical writer, I’ve had the privilege of watching technology evolve. My early days were spent drafting documents in rather clunky word processors that many of you probably haven’t heard of. Over time, I’ve adapted, even though it meant picking up skills in coding languages that didn’t exist when I got my Master’s degree.

Living near the intersection where nature meets industry—often seen during my walks on a trail near what the locals call ""The Rock""—has been quite a meditative experience. If you’re from around here, you might understand the sudden stillness I am talking about.

While it’s a harmonious life now, it hasn’t always been that way. My spouse and I balanced juggling careers with family life, and even though our little ones have long flown the nest, the lessons learned remain invaluable. Speaking of family, I still remember stories from back home about an ancestral lighthouse keeper—which may explain my love for maritime history.

Anyone else find it cathartic to look back and connect those dots? Feel free to share your stories; I’d love to hear perspectives from different walks of life.

Warm regards,

As I navigated the calls today, connecting countless voices, it struck me how, much like the layered conversations I facilitate, our lives are enriched by the varied stories shared. 

Reflecting on my 12 years as a Telephone Operator, seeing the changes in our little corner of the Keystone State, makes me proud of the adaptability and resilience we harbor. After completing my Associate Degree from a well-known local community college, the path here in PA shaped me in ways, instilling in me a sense of community and purpose. Being among those who keep the communication flowing feels rewarding, though it’s often an unspoken role. 

Managing a work-life balance was always a challenge, especially while transitioning into single parenthood – my beloved passed away a few years back. My earning of $41,590 supports my small family, and every day lived is a testimony to resilience and strength.

It's been a tough year filled with ups and downs, but I recently found a glimmer of hope. Let me share a bit about my journey and maybe it will resonate with some of you.

After a long day of handling calls, I usually unwind by taking long walks around my neighborhood, which is full of charming, old-fashioned street lamps that remind me of the time when movies were filmed in black and white. It’s these moments of peace that get me through my days—especially since it's only been a little over two years since my husband passed. Sometimes, I walk around Adams and Pennsylvania, near that little bakery with the strawberry tarts that remind me of simpler times.

My job as a telephone operator can be pretty demanding, and while it keeps me busy, it also gives me a sense of stability. My day starts at dawn, and by the time I get home, I'm ready to indulge in some 90s R&B. It's a rhythm I've embraced, one that lets me honor the memories of my late husband while moving forward. 

I never thought I'd find solace in such small moments, like hearing the bell ring at the corner of Third and Spruce or seeing that quirky mural on Willow Avenue. One of my favorite escapes recently has been driving to that spot right by the town's annual festival grounds, even in off-seasons—it’s like my little slice of serenity away from the hustle.

And can I tell you how amusing it is seeing my savings slightly grow as I stick to my $41,590 yearly salary? Every little bit counts when you've got dreams of maybe one day owning a cozy little place with a garden, just like we used to talk about.

For those wondering, yes, I did complete my Associate degree a few years back. I laugh thinking about the late-night cramming sessions at that tiny café tucked between Main Street and the old library. Those were the days.

In a life filled with transitions and new beginnings, it’s grounding to have a few constants, even if they’re just the street corners and sounds that make up my daily backdrop. For all of you who might be finding your way through similar landscapes, what are the little things or routines that give you peace?

Some nights, it feels like the phone never stops ringing. I can't believe it's been almost 16 years since I graduated from a small community college just a few bus stops away from where I work now. Strange how life has a way of coming full circle. I miss those carefree days when I used to grab a coffee from that little shop right near King and Maple. Now, with a lot more responsibility and a bit of a broken heart, I find comfort in my work, even if it can be draining. 

The house is quieter now, an echo of memories of when Jason and I used to dance in the living room to our favorite songs. It's been three years since he passed, but some days the pain feels just as raw. 

Regardless of the challenges, I know he'd be proud of the way I've managed to keep things together. Pennsylvania might feel like a long way from those summers visiting Grandma's home in the south, but it’s where I’ve built my life. Can't wait for the weekend, maybe I'll take a drive out to that field we used to visit, just off the old highway. It's those little moments and places that keep me grounded. 

Gearing up to enjoy my favorite guilty pleasure - a pint of ice cream from that small store near the intersection of Maple Ave and Elm St. Life is never easy, but it's in embracing the small joys that we find solace.",REHMAT SEWPERSAUD,Facebook,34,Female,Black,United States,41590,Telephone Operators,Pennsylvania,Associate degree,Widowed,5

Today marks a significant milestone in my journey as a Credit Counselor and Loan Officer. It's been 14 years since I first embarked on this path, right after I graduated with my Bachelor's degree back in 2007. It's incredible how time flies, and the experiences I've had working here in the heart of Texas have been nothing short of enriching.

Balancing my professional life and personal commitments has been a journey. Between analyzing credit reports and helping families secure their dream homes, I cherish my escapes to the less crowded, serene corner just off Preston Road where my husband and I enjoy our evening walks and some delectable local cuisine. Speaking of family, navigating my responsibilities at work and home has surely taught me the essence of time management and patience.

On the financial front, it's humbling to reflect on how we've been able to secure a stable living. My current earning of $81,640 has allowed us to plan for a secure future, and I'm grateful that I can use my expertise to help others achieve their financial goals. In particular, knowing that we contribute to the community's financial literacy and comfort gives me immense satisfaction.

For those looking to join or grow in this field, I'm more than happy to share insights and assist where I can. Let's connect and grow together!

Title: Navigating the Loan Landscape in a Post-Pandemic World: Insights from the Field 

Hey everyone,

I've been working as a Credit Counselor and Loan Officer for over a decade now, and recently, I've noticed some really interesting (and sometimes concerning) trends in the lending landscape, especially here in the Lone Star State. As someone who's clocked in countless hours at a desk overlooking the skyline where the Langley meets Alton—the view is quite something, I must say—I thought I'd share some insights that might help you navigate these choppy financial waters.

First off, let's talk about the post-pandemic shift. The financial instability of the past couple of years has forced many of us to reevaluate our approaches to credit and loans. Borrowing rates and terms have seen some unpredictable changes, and this has particularly affected the housing market. In my position, I often find myself advising clients who are confused by the discrepancy between their pre-pandemic financial plans and the current scenario.

Having grown up juggling finances here and there, with my first educational milestone tackled en route to an epic graduation night in a venue off Upland and Pomeroy, I've always had a personal interest in economic stability. This has been fueled both by my career and by my desire to secure a stable financial future for my family—yes, that includes a wonderful spouse and our cherished memories of exploring the beautiful hill country each fall.

One piece of advice I consistently give: it's crucial to stay updated on your credit score and be proactive in managing it. It's amazing how many people overlook this simple yet significant aspect. During those long weekends when my husband and I road trip from Hays to find the perfect BBQ joint, I often end up fielding client calls about sudden credit dilemmas. Trust me, it's never too early to start planning.

Lastly, for those of you who might need a friendly reminder, never underestimate the benefit of speaking to a well-informed counselor. Whether you're contemplating your first mortgage or juggling student loans while eyeing that dream home near Westchase and Embassy—taking the time to talk to someone with expertise can make all the difference.

Looking forward to hearing your experiences and questions. Let's help each other out in these uncertain times!

Best,
Balkaran Alamari

It's fulfilling to witness the transformation of someone's financial life from stress to stability. It's moments like these that make me appreciate my role as a Credit Counselor and Loan Officer. 

Got to unwind later at one of my favorite spots, near Jenkins Park. It’s got this amazing tranquility that’s hard to find elsewhere in the hustle and bustle of our lively state. As someone who’s lived in the Lone Star State my whole life, it’s these little hidden corners that keep me grounded and remind me why I love this place so much. 

Now, time to canoodle a bit before heading back to the home I share with my partner of over a decade. Balancing work and personal life can be tough, but I've found my groove with support from them and their hilarious attempts at baking lately.
